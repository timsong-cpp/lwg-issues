<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
LWG issue <a href="2180">2180</a> points out some deficiences in regard to the specification of the library-provided
type <tt>std::seed_seq</tt> regarding exceptions, but there is another specification problem 
in regard to general types satisfying the <em>seed sequence</em> constraints (named <tt>SSeq</tt>) as described in 
26.6.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.req.seedseq">[rand.req.seedseq]</a>.
<p/>
26.6.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.eng">[rand.eng]</a> p3 and 26.6.5.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.adapt.general">[rand.adapt.general]</a> p3 say upfront:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Except where specified otherwise, no function described in this section 
26.6.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.eng">[rand.eng]</a>/26.6.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.adapt">[rand.adapt]</a> throws an exception.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This constraint causes problems, because the described templates in these sub-clauses depend on operations of 
<tt>SSeq::generate()</tt> which is a function template, that depends both on operations provided by the 
implementor of <tt>SSeq</tt> (e.g. of <tt>std::seed_seq</tt>), and those of the random access iterator type 
provided by the caller. With class template <tt>linear_congruential_engine</tt> we have just one example for a user 
of <tt>SSeq::generate()</tt> via:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class Sseq&gt; 
linear_congruential_engine&lt;&gt;::linear_congruential_engine(Sseq&amp; q);

template&lt;class Sseq&gt; 
void linear_congruential_engine&lt;&gt;::seed(Sseq&amp; q);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
None of these operations has an exclusion rule for exceptions.
<p/>
As described in <a href="2180">2180</a> the wording for <tt>std::seed_seq</tt> should and can be fixed to ensure that 
operations of <tt>seed_seq::generate()</tt> won't throw except from operations of the provided iterator range, 
but there is no corresponding "safety belt" for user-provided <tt>SSeq</tt> types, since 26.6.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.req.seedseq">[rand.req.seedseq]</a>
does not impose no-throw requirements onto operations of <em>seed sequences</em>.
</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">

<li><p>
A quite radical step to fix this problem would be to impose general no-throw requirements on the expression
<tt>q.generate(rb,re)</tt> from Table 115, but this is not as simple as it looks initially, because this
function again depends on general types that are mutable random access iterators. Typically, we do not
impose no-throw requirements on iterator operations and this would restrict general seed sequences where
exceptions are not a problem. Furthermore, we do not impose comparable constraints for other expressions,
like that of the expression <tt>g()</tt> in Table 116 for good reasons, e.g. <tt>random_device::operator()</tt>
explicitly states when it throws exceptions.
</p></li>

<li><p>
A less radical variant of the previous suggestion would be to add a normative requirement on the expression
<tt>q.generate(rb,re)</tt> from Table 115 that says: "Throws nothing if operations of <tt>rb</tt> and <tt>re</tt> 
do not throw exceptions". Nevertheless we typically do not describe <em>conditional</em> Throws elements in proper
requirement sets elsewhere (Container requirements excluded, they just describe the containers from Clause 23)
and this may exclude resonable implementations of seed sequences that could throw exceptions under rare
situations. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
The iterator arguments provided to <tt>SSeq::generate()</tt> for operations in templates of 26.6.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.eng">[rand.eng]</a> and 
26.6.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.adapt">[rand.adapt]</a> are under control of implementations, so we could impose stricter exceptions requirements
on <tt>SSeq::generate()</tt> for <tt>SSeq</tt> types that are used to instantiate member templates in 26.6.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.eng">[rand.eng]</a> 
and 26.6.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.adapt">[rand.adapt]</a> solely.
</p></li>

<li><p>
We simply add extra wording to the introductive parts of 26.6.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.eng">[rand.eng]</a> and 26.6.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.adapt">[rand.adapt]</a>
that specify that operations of the engine (adaptor) templates that depend on a template parameter <tt>SSeq</tt>
throw no exception unless <tt>SSeq::generate()</tt> throws an exception.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Given these options I would suggest to apply the variant described in the fourth bullet.
<p/>
The proposed resolution attempts to reduce a lot of the redundancies of requirements in the introductory paragraphs of 
26.6.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.eng">[rand.eng]</a> and 26.6.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.adapt">[rand.adapt]</a> by introducing a new intermediate sub-clause 
"Engine and engine adaptor class templates" following sub-clause 26.6.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.synopsis">[rand.synopsis]</a>. This approach also
solves the problem that currently 26.6.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.eng">[rand.eng]</a> also describes requirements that apply for
26.6.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.adapt">[rand.adapt]</a> (Constrained templates involving the <tt>Sseq</tt> parameters).
</p>

<p><i>[2013-04-20, Bristol]</i></p>


<p>
Remove the first bullet point:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
?- Throughout this sub-clause general requirements and conventions are described that apply to every class 
template specified in sub-clause 26.6.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.eng">[rand.eng]</a> and 26.6.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.adapt">[rand.adapt]</a>. Phrases of the form "in those 
sub-clauses" shall be interpreted as equivalent to "in sub-clauses 26.6.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.eng">[rand.eng]</a> and 26.6.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.adapt">[rand.adapt]</a>". 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Replace "in those sub-clauses" with "in sub-clauses 26.6.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.eng">[rand.eng]</a> and 26.6.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.adapt">[rand.adapt]</a>".
<p/>
Find another place for the wording. 
<p/>
Daniel: These are requirements on the implementation not on the types. I'm not comfortable in moving it to another place 
without double checking. 
<p/>
Improve the text (there are 4 "for"s): <em>for</em> copy constructors, <em>for</em> copy assignment operators, 
<em>for</em> streaming operators, and <em>for</em> equality and inequality operators are not shown in the synopses. 
<p/>
Move the information of this paragraph to the paragraphs it refers to: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"-?- Descriptions are provided in those sub-clauses only for engine operations that are not described in 
26.6.3.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.req.eng">[rand.req.eng]</a>, for adaptor operations that are not described in 26.6.3.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.req.adapt">[rand.req.adapt]</a>, or for 
operations where there is additional semantic information. In particular, declarations for copy constructors, for 
copy assignment operators, for streaming operators, and for equality and inequality operators are not shown in the synopses." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Alisdair: I prefer duplication here than consolidation/reference to these paragraphs. 
<p/>
The room showed weakly favjust or for duplication.

<p><i>[Lenexa 2015-05-07: Move to Ready]</i></p>

<p>LWG 2181 exceptions from seed sequence operations</p>
<p>STL: Daniel explained that I was confused. I said, oh, seed_seq says it can throw if the RanIt throws. Daniel says the RanIts are provided by the engine. Therefore if you give a seed_seq to an engine, it cannot throw, as implied by the current normative text. So what Daniel has in the PR is correct, if slightly unnecessary. It's okay to have explicitly non-overlapping Standardese even if overlapping would be okay.</p>
<p>Marshall: And this is a case where the std:: on seed_seq is a good thing.</p>
<p>STL: Meh.</p>
<p>STL: And that was my only concern with this PR. I like the latest PR much better than the previous.</p>
<p>Marshall: Yes. There's a drive-by fix for referencing the wrong section. Other than that, the two are the same.</p>
<p>STL: Alisdair wanted the repetition instead of centralization, and I agree.</p>
<p>Marshall: Any other opinions?</p>
<p>Jonathan: I'll buy it.</p>
<p>STL: For a dollar?</p>
<p>Hwrd: I'll buy that for a nickel.</p>

the value(s) of its non-type template parameter(s), to hold. A program instantiating any of these templates is ill-formed if
any such required relationship fails to hold.
