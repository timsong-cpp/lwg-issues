Assuming we adopt the
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n1836.pdf">C
compatibility package from C99</a>  what should be the return type of the
following signature be:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
?  pow(float, int);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
C++03 says that the return type should be <tt>float</tt>. 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n1836.pdf">
TR1</a> and C90&#47;99 say the return type should be <tt>double</tt>.  This can put
clients into a situation where C++03 provides answers that are not as high
quality as C90&#47;C99&#47;TR1.  For example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

int main()
{
    float x = 2080703.375F;
    double y = pow(x, 2);
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Assuming an IEEE 32 bit float and IEEE 64 bit double, C90&#47;C99&#47;TR1 all suggest:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
y = 4329326534736.390625
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
which is exactly right.  While C++98&#47;C++03 demands:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
y = 4329326510080.
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
which is only approximately right.
</p>

<p>
I recommend that C++0X adopt the mixed mode arithmetic already adopted by
Fortran, C and TR1 and make the return type of <tt>pow(float,int)</tt> be
<tt>double</tt>.
</p>

<p><i>[
Kona (2007): Other functions that are affected by this issue include
<tt>ldexp</tt>, <tt>scalbln</tt>, and <tt>scalbn</tt>. We also believe that there is a typo in
26.7&#47;10: <tt>float nexttoward(float, long double);</tt> [sic] should be <tt>float
nexttoward(float, float);</tt> Proposed Disposition: Review (the proposed
resolution appears above, rather than below, the heading "Proposed
resolution")

<p><i>[Howard, post Kona:]</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Unfortunately I strongly disagree with a part of the resolution
from Kona.  I am moving from New to Open instead of to Review because I do not believe
we have consensus on the intent of the resolution.
</p>
<p>
This issue does not include <tt>ldexp</tt>, <tt>scalbln</tt>, and <tt>scalbn</tt> because
the second integral parameter in each of these signatures (from C99) is <b>not</b> a
<i>generic parameter</i> according to C99 7.22p2.  The corresponding C++ overloads are
intended (as far as I know) to correspond directly to C99's definition of <i>generic parameter</i>.
</p>
<p>
For similar reasons, I do not believe that the second <tt>long double</tt> parameter of
<tt>nexttoward</tt>, nor the return type of this function, is in error.  I believe the
correct signature is:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
float nexttoward(float, long double);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
which is what both the C++0X working paper and C99 state (as far as I currently understand).
</p>
<p>
This is really <b>only</b> about <tt>pow(float, int)</tt>.  And this is because C++98 took one
route (with <tt>pow</tt> only) and C99 took another (with many math functions in <tt>&lt;tgmath.h&gt;</tt>.
The proposed resolution basically says: C++98 got it wrong and C99 got it right; let's go with C99.
</p>

<p><i>[
Bellevue:
]</i></p>


<blockquote><p>
This signature was not picked up from C99. Instead, if one types
<tt>pow(2.0f,2)</tt>, the promotion rules will invoke "double pow(double,
double)", which generally gives special treatment for integral
exponents, preserving full accuracy of the result.  New proposed
wording provided.
</p></blockquote>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
Change 25.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/c.math">[c.math]</a> p10:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The added signatures are:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
...
<del>float pow(float, int);</del>
...
<del>double pow(double, int);</del>
...
<del>long double pow(long double, int);</del>
</pre></blockquote>
