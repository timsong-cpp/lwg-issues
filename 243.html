<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>basic_istream&lt;&gt;::get(), and basic_istream&lt;&gt;::getline(),
are unclear with respect to the behavior and side-effects of the named
functions in case of an error.</p>

<p>27.6.1.3, p1 states that &quot;... If the sentry object returns
true, when converted to a value of type bool, the function endeavors
to obtain the requested input...&quot; It is not clear from this (or
the rest of the paragraph) what precisely the behavior should be when
the sentry ctor exits by throwing an exception or when the sentry
object returns false.  In particular, what is the number of characters
extracted that gcount() returns supposed to be?</p>

<p>27.6.1.3 p8 and p19 say about the effects of get() and getline():
&quot;...  In any case, it then stores a null character (using
charT()) into the next successive location of the array.&quot; Is not
clear whether this sentence applies if either of the conditions above
holds (i.e., when sentry fails).</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>Add to 27.6.1.3, p1 after the sentence</p>

<blockquote><p>
&quot;... If the sentry object returns true, when converted to a value of
type bool, the function endeavors to obtain the requested input.&quot;
</p></blockquote>

<p>the following</p>


<blockquote><p>
&quot;Otherwise, if the sentry constructor exits by throwing an exception or
if the sentry object returns false, when converted to a value of type
bool, the function returns without attempting to obtain any input. In
either case the number of extracted characters is set to 0; unformatted
input functions taking a character array of non-zero size as an argument
shall also store a null character (using charT()) in the first location
of the array.&quot;
</p></blockquote>


<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>Although the general philosophy of the input functions is that the
argument should not be modified upon failure, <tt>getline</tt>
historically added a terminating null unconditionally.  Most
implementations still do that.  Earlier versions of the draft standard
had language that made this an unambiguous requirement; those words
were moved to a place where their context made them less clear.  See
Jerry Schwarz's message c++std-lib-7618.</p>
