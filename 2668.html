<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>This doesn't seem to be in Boost.Filesystem, so maybe it isn't needed,
but since <code>path += path2</code> works then it seems reasonable to expect
<code>path1 + path2</code> to work as well.</p>

  <p><i>[04 Jul 2014 Beman Dawes comments:]</i></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The 12 overloads required by <code>basic_string operator+</code> scared me off,
    and I never came back to the issue.</p>  
  </blockquote>

  <p><i>[22 Nov 2015 Beman supplies proposed resolution wording.]</i></p>

 
<p><i>[<b>Apr 2016 Issue updated to address the C++ Working Paper. Previously addressed File System TS</b>]</i></p>
 




<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>NAD, Future.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>It is not necessary to provide every possible string operation for class
  <code>path</code> because it is always possible to convert to a string,
  perform the operation, and convert back to a path. The most commonly needed string
  operations are provided for class <code>path</code> as a convenience, but every added
  function comes at the cost of increased interface complexity. In this case, the cost
  is judged to outweigh the convenience.</p>
  
  <p>Future changes to the language, such as concepts, and changes to the library, such as
  <code>basic_string_view</code>, may allow reduction of the complexity of the class path
  interface. The LWG may wish to reconsider this issue at that time.</p>
