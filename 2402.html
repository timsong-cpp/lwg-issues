21.3.1.2 [string.cons] p3 specifies:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
basic_string(const basic_string&amp; str, size_type pos, size_type n = npos, const Allocator&amp; a = Allocator());
</pre>
<p>
But this implies that <tt>basic_string(str, pos)</tt> and <tt>basic_string(str, pos, n)</tt> use <tt>Allocator()</tt> 
instead of getting an allocator from <tt>str</tt>.
<p/>
21.3.1.1 [string.require] p3 says "The <tt>Allocator</tt> object used shall be obtained as described in 23.2.1."  
23.2.1 [container.requirements.general] p8 says "Copy constructors for these container types obtain an allocator 
by calling <tt>allocator_traits&lt;allocator_type&gt;::select_on_container_copy_construction</tt> on the allocator 
belonging to the container being copied.", but this isn't exactly a copy constructor. Then it talks about move constructors 
(which this definitely isn't), and finally says that "All other constructors for these container types take a 
<tt>const allocator_type&amp;</tt> argument. [&hellip;] A copy of this allocator is used for any memory allocation performed".
</p>

<p>STL: there an allocator right there in str, why default-construct one</p>
<p>STL: my fix, which may not be right, splits out functions with and without allocators</p>
<p>JW: there are other ways to propagate the allocator from str to the new object</p>
<p>PJP: hard to get motivated about this one</p>
<p>JW: I think this is not a copy operation, this is init'ing a string from a range of characters which happens to originate in a string. It makes it inconsistent with the similar ctor taking a const char pointer, and if we had a std::string_view we wouldn't even have this ctor, and it wouldn't be possible to propagate the allocator.</p>
<p>STL: but people with stateful allocators want it to propagate</p>
<p>JW: I think the people using stateful allocators will alter the default behaviour of select_on_container_copy_construction so that it doesn't propagate, but will return a default-constructed one (to ensure a stateful allocator referring to a stack buffer doesn't leak to a region where the stack buffer has gone). So for those people, your proposed change does nothing, it changes one default-constructed allocator to a call to select_on_container_copy_construction which returns a default-constructed allocator. For other people who have different stateful allocators they can still provide the right allocator (whatever that may be) by passing it in.</p>
<p>STL: OK, that's convincing.</p>
<p>PJP: I agree with Jonathan</p>
<p>JW: would like to run both our arguments by Pablo in case I'm totally misrepresenting the expected users of allocator-traits stuff</p>

<p><i>[2015-10, Kona Saturday afternoon]</i></p>

<p>Everyone thinks this seems right.</p>
<p>STL: It'd be really weird if you copy from a string with a stateful allocator and you'd just default-construct a new allocator.</p>
<p>EF: We definitely need this for polymorphic allocators.</p>
<p>TK: Whether you think this is kind of copy-constructor or a constructor from raw string data, the new form in the PR is more flexible. You can still get the default-constructed allocator if you want, but conversely, getting the select_on_container_copy is really hard to type in the old form.</p>
<p>JW has objections (written in the issue) but won't block "Review" status.</p>
<p>Move to Review, hopefully to be made ready at a telecon.</p>

I like the direction of the PR, but it is incomplete. Consider the following (assuming the PR):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
typedef basic_string&lt;char, char_traits&lt;char&gt;, A&lt;char&gt;&gt; stringA;
vector&lt;stringA, scoped_allocator_adaptor&lt;A&lt;stringA&gt;&gt;&gt; vs;
stringA s;

vs.emplace_back(s, 2);  // Ill-formed
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The problem is that uses-allocator construction requires that we be able to pass an allocator to the constructor 
<tt>stringA(s, 2, allocator)</tt>, but no such constructor exists. I think this defect already exists, but we should 
fix it a the same time that we fix 2402. So, I would say we need a third constructor:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
basic_string(const basic_string&amp; str, size_type pos, const Allocator&amp; a);
</pre></blockquote>

<p><i>[2016-01-05, Pablo comments]</i></p>

<p>
I've reconsidered and I think that the issue as stated, is NAD. I do not like the PR <em>at all</em>. In fact, I think it reverses 
a previous fix and it could break existing code.
<p/>
There are two patterns that are at work here:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Every constructor needs a version with and without an allocator argument (possibly through the use of default arguments).</p></li>
<li><p>Every constructor except the copy constructor for which an allocator is not provided uses a default-constructed allocator.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
The constructors in question are not copy constructors. I do not think it is compelling that the allocator should come 
from its argument any more than it should come from any other object that happens to supply characters for a string 
constructor.

<p><i>[2016-03 Jacksonville]</i></p>

Closed as NAD, noting that <a href="2583">2583</a> is a related issue.
