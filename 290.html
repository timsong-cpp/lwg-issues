<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>The specification of the for_each algorithm does not have a
&quot;Requires&quot; section, which means that there are no
restrictions imposed on the function object whatsoever. In essence it
means that I can provide any function object with arbitrary side
effects and I can still expect a predictable result. In particular I
can expect that the function object is applied exactly last - first
times, which is promised in the &quot;Complexity&quot; section.
</p>

<p>I don't see how any implementation can give such a guarantee
without imposing requirements on the function object.
</p>

<p>Just as an example: consider a function object that removes
elements from the input sequence.  In that case, what does the
complexity guarantee (applies f exactly last - first times) mean?
</p>

<p>One can argue that this is obviously a nonsensical application and
a theoretical case, which unfortunately it isn't.  I have seen
programmers shooting themselves in the foot this way, and they did not
understand that there are restrictions even if the description of the
algorithm does not say so.
</p>
<p><i>[Lillehammer: This is more general than for_each.  We don't want
  the function object in transform invalidiating iterators
  either. There should be a note somewhere in clause 17 (17, not 25)
  saying that user code operating on a range may not invalidate
  iterators unless otherwise specified.  Bill will provide wording.]</i></p>

Moved to NAD.

<p>
It was felt that the current description is adequate, and that there are
limits to what the standard can reasonably say to prohibit perverse uses
of the library.
