<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>

C++ Standard Library  templates that take an allocator  as an argument
are    required    to    call    the    <code>allocate()</code>    and
<code>deallocate()</code>  members of the  allocator object  to obtain
storage.  However, they do not appear to be required to call any other
allocator      members      such     as      <code>construct()</code>,
<code>destroy()</code>,           <code>address()</code>,          and
<code>max_size()</code>.  This makes these allocator members less than
useful in portable programs.

        </p>
        <p>

It's unclear to me whether the absence of the requirement to use these
allocator  members  is  an  unintentional  omission  or  a  deliberate
choice. However,  since the functions exist in  the standard allocator
and  since  they are  required  to  be  provided by  any  user-defined
allocator I  believe the standard  ought to be clarified  to explictly
specify  whether programs  should or  should not  be able  to  rely on
standard containers calling the functions.

        </p>
        <p>

I  propose  that all  containers  be required  to  make  use of  these
functions.

    <p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
       <p>

Specifically, I propose to change 23.2 [container.requirements],
p9 as follows:

       </p>
           <blockquote>
<p>
-9- Copy constructors  for all container types defined  in this clause
<ins>that   are  parametrized  on   <code>Allocator</code></ins>  copy
<del>an</del><ins>the</ins>  allocator argument from  their respective
first parameters.

All other  constructors for  these container types  take a<del>n</del>
<ins>const</ins>  <code>Allocator&amp;</code>  argument  (20.1.6),  an
allocator whose <code>value_type</code> is the same as the container's
<code>value_type</code>.

A copy of this  argument <del>is</del><ins>shall be</ins> used for any
memory  allocation <ins> and  deallocation</ins> performed<del>,</del>
by these  constructors and by all  member functions<del>,</del> during
the  lifetime  of each  container  object.   <ins>Allocation shall  be
performed  "as  if"  by  calling  the  <code>allocate()</code>  member
function on  a copy  of the allocator  object of the  appropriate type
<sup>New  Footnote)</sup>,   and  deallocation  "as   if"  by  calling
<code>deallocate()</code> on  a copy of  the same allocator  object of
the corresponding type.</ins>

<ins>A  copy of  this argument  shall also  be used  to  construct and
destroy objects whose lifetime  is managed by the container, including
but not  limited to those of  the container's <code>value_type</code>,
and  to  obtain  their  address.   All  objects  residing  in  storage
allocated by a  container's allocator shall be constructed  "as if" by
calling the <code>construct()</code> member  function on a copy of the
allocator object of  the appropriate type.  The same  objects shall be
destroyed "as if"  by calling <code>destroy()</code> on a  copy of the
same allocator object  of the same type.  The  address of such objects
shall be obtained "as if" by calling the <code>address()</code> member
function  on  a  copy  of  the allocator  object  of  the  appropriate
type.</ins>

<ins>Finally, a copy  of this argument shall be  used by its container
object to determine  the maximum number of objects  of the container's
<code>value_type</code> the container may  store at the same time. The
container  member function <code>max_size()</code> obtains  this number
from      the      value      returned      by     a      call      to
<code>get_allocator().max_size()</code>.</ins>

In   all  container   types  defined   in  this   clause <ins>that  are
parametrized     on    <code>Allocator</code></ins>,     the    member
<code>get_allocator()</code>     returns     a     copy     of     the
<code>Allocator</code>     object     used     to    construct     the
container.<sup>258)</sup>
</p>
<p>
New Footnote: This type  may be different from <code>Allocator</code>:
it     may    be     derived    from     <code>Allocator</code>    via
<code>Allocator::rebind&lt;U&gt;::other</code>   for  the  appropriate
type <code>U</code>.
</p>
           </blockquote>
       <p>

The proposed wording seems cumbersome but I couldn't think of a better
way   to  describe   the   requirement  that   containers  use   their
<code>Allocator</code>  to manage  only objects  (regardless  of their
type)  that  persist  over  their  lifetimes  and  not,  for  example,
temporaries  created on the  stack. That  is, containers  shouldn't be
required  to  call  <code>Allocator::construct(Allocator::allocate(1),
elem)</code>  just to  construct a  temporary copy  of an  element, or
<code>Allocator::destroy(Allocator::address(temp),     1)</code>    to
destroy temporaries.
