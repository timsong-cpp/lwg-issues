<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Clause  [except.unexpected] paragraph 1 says that "void unexpected();
is called (18.7.2) immediately after completing the stack unwinding
for the former function", but 18.7.2.4 (Effects) says that "void
unexpected(); . . . Calls the unexpected_handler function in effect
immediately after evaluating the throwexpression (18.7.2.2),".  Isn't
here a contradiction: 15.5.2 requires stack have been unwound when in
void unexpected() and therefore in unexpected_handler but 18.7.2.4
claims that unexpected_handler is called "in effect immediately" after
evaluation of throw expression is finished, so there is no space left
for stack to be unwound therefore?  I think the phrase "in effect
immediately" should be removed from the standard because it brings
ambiguity in understanding.
</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>


<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>There is no contradiction.  The phrase "in effect immediately" is
  just to clarify which handler is to be called.</p>
