<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In table 74, the return type of the expression <tt>*a</tt> is given
as <tt>T&amp;</tt>, where <tt>T</tt> is the iterator's value type.
For constant iterators, however, this is wrong.  ("Value type"
is never defined very precisely, but it is clear that the value type
of, say, <tt>std::list&lt;int&gt;::const_iterator</tt> is supposed to be
<tt>int</tt>, not <tt>const int</tt>.)
</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
In table 74, in the <tt>*a</tt> and <tt>*r++</tt> rows, change the
return type from "<tt>T&amp;</tt>" to "<tt>T&amp;</tt>
if <tt>X</tt> is mutable, otherwise <tt>const T&amp;</tt>".
In the <tt>a-&gt;m</tt> row, change the return type from
"<tt>U&amp;</tt>" to "<tt>U&amp;</tt> if <tt>X</tt> is mutable,
otherwise <tt>const U&amp;</tt>".
</p>

<p><i>[Tokyo: The LWG believes this is the tip of a larger iceberg;
there are multiple const problems with the STL portion of the library
and that these should be addressed as a single package.&nbsp; Note
that issue <a href="lwg-defects.html#180">180</a> has already been declared NAD Future for
that very reason.]</i></p>


<p><i>[Redmond: the LWG thinks this is separable from other constness
issues.  This issue is just cleanup; it clarifies language that was
written before we had iterator_traits.  Proposed resolution was
modified: the original version only discussed *a.  It was pointed out
that we also need to worry about *r++ and a-&gt;m.]</i></p>
