<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>Scott Meyers, in a comp.std.c++ posting: I just noticed that
section 3.7.3.1 of CD2 seems to allow for the possibility that all
calls to operator new(0) yield the same pointer, an implementation
technique specifically prohibited by ARM 5.3.3.Was this prohibition
really lifted? Does the FDIS agree with CD2 in the regard? [Issues
list maintainer's note: the IS is the same.]</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>Change the last paragraph of 3.7.3 from:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Any allocation and/or deallocation functions defined in a C++ program shall
  conform to the semantics specified in 3.7.3.1 and 3.7.3.2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Any allocation and/or deallocation functions defined in a C++ program,
  including the default versions in the library, shall conform to the semantics
  specified in 3.7.3.1 and 3.7.3.2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Change 3.7.3.1/2, next-to-last sentence, from :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If the size of the space requested is zero, the value returned shall not be
  a null pointer value (4.10).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Even if the size of the space requested is zero, the request can fail. If
  the request succeeds, the value returned shall be a non-null pointer value
  (4.10) p0 different from any previously returned value p1, unless that value
  p1 was since passed to an operator delete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5.3.4/7 currently reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When the value of the expression in a direct-new-declarator is zero, the
  allocation function is called to allocate an array with no elements. The
  pointer returned by the new-expression is non-null. [Note: If the library
  allocation function is called, the pointer returned is distinct from the
  pointer to any other object.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Retain the first sentence, and delete the remainder.</p>
<p>18.5.1 currently has no text. Add the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Except where otherwise specified, the provisions of 3.7.3 apply to the
  library versions of operator new and operator delete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To 18.5.1.3, add the following text:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The provisions of 3.7.3 do not apply to these reserved placement forms of
  operator new and operator delete.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>See 99-0040/N1216, October 22, 1999, by Stephen D. Clamage for the analysis
supporting to the proposed resolution.</p>
