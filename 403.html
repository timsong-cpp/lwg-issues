<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
std::basic_string, 21.3.1 [basic.string] paragraph 2 says that
basic_string "conforms to the requirements of a Sequence, as specified
in (23.1.1)." The sequence requirements specified in (23.1.1) to not
include any prohibition on swap members throwing exceptions.
</p>

<p>
Section 23.2 [container.requirements] paragraph 10 does limit conditions under
which exceptions may be thrown, but applies only to "all container
types defined in this clause" and so excludes basic_string::swap
because it is defined elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Eric Niebler points out that 21.3.1 [basic.string] paragraph 5 explicitly
permits basic_string::swap to invalidates iterators, which is
disallowed by 23.2 [container.requirements] paragraph 10. Thus the standard would
be contradictory if it were read or extended to read as having
basic_string meet 23.2 [container.requirements] paragraph 10 requirements.
</p>

<p>
Yet several LWG members have expressed the belief that the original
intent was that basic_string::swap should not throw exceptions as
specified by 23.2 [container.requirements] paragraph 10, and that the standard is
unclear on this issue. The complexity of basic_string::swap is
specified as "constant time", indicating the intent was to avoid
copying (which could cause a bad_alloc or other exception). An
important use of swap is to ensure that exceptions are not thrown in
exception-safe code.
</p>

<p>
Note: There remains long standing concern over whether or not it is
possible to reasonably meet the 23.2 [container.requirements] paragraph 10 swap
requirements when allocators are unequal. The specification of
basic_string::swap exception requirements is in no way intended to
address, prejudice, or otherwise impact that concern.
</p>







<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
In 99 [string.swap], add a throws clause:
</p>

<p>
Throws: Shall not throw exceptions.
</p>
