23.2 [container.requirements]p10 states:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Unless otherwise specified (see 23.2.2.3 and 23.2.5.4) all container types defined in this clause meet the following
additional requirements:
</p>
<ul>

<li>[...]</li>

<li>no <tt>erase()</tt>, <tt>pop_back()</tt> or <tt>pop_front()</tt> function throws an exception.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
23.3.8.4 [deque.modifiers] and 23.3.11.5 [vector.modifiers] offer
additional guarantees for <tt>deque</tt>/<tt>vector insert()</tt> and
<tt>erase()</tt> members. However, 23.2 [container.requirements] p10 
does not mention 23.2.7.1 [unord.req.except] that specifies exception 
safety guarantees for unordered containers. In addition,  
23.2.7.1 [unord.req.except] p1 offers the following guaratee for
<tt>erase()</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
No <tt>erase()</tt> function throws an exception unless that exception
is thrown by the container's Hash or Pred object (if any).
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Summary:
</p>

<p>
According to 23.2 [container.requirements] p10 no
<tt>erase()</tt> function should throw an exception unless otherwise
specified. Although does not explicitly mention 23.2.7.1 [unord.req.except], this section offers additional guarantees
for unordered containers, allowing <tt>erase()</tt> to throw if
predicate or hash function throws.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, associative containers have no exception safety guarantees
section so no <tt>erase()</tt> function should throw, <em>including
<tt>erase(k)</tt></em> that needs to use the predicate function to
perform its work. This means that the predicate of an associative
container is not allowed to throw.
</p>

<p>
So:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<tt>erase(k)</tt> for associative containers is not allowed to throw. On
the other hand, <tt>erase(k)</tt> for unordered associative containers
is allowed to throw.
</li>
<li>
<tt>erase(q)</tt> for associative containers is not allowed to throw. On
the other hand, <tt>erase(q)</tt> for unordered associative containers
is allowed to throw if it uses the hash or predicate.
</li>
<li>
To fulfill 1), predicates of associative containers are not allowed to throw.
Predicates of unordered associative containers are allowed to throw.
</li>
<li>
2) breaks a widely used programming pattern (flyweight pattern) for
unordered containers, where objects are registered in a global map in
their constructors and unregistered in their destructors. If <tt>erase(q)</tt> is
allowed to throw, the destructor of the object would need to rethrow the
exception or swallow it, leaving the object registered.
</li>
</ol>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
Create a new sub-section of 23.2.6 [associative.reqmts] (perhaps 
[associative.req.except]) titled "Exception safety guarantees".
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
1 For associative containers, no <tt>clear()</tt> function throws an exception.
<tt>erase(k)</tt> does not throw an exception unless that exception is thrown by
the container's Pred object (if any).
</p>

<p>
2 For associative containers, if an exception is thrown by any operation
from within an <tt>insert()</tt> function inserting a single element, the
<tt>insert()</tt> function has no effect.
</p>

<p>
3 For associative containers, no <tt>swap</tt> function throws an exception
unless that exception is thrown by the copy constructor or copy
assignment operator of the container's Pred object (if any).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Change 23.2.7.1 [unord.req.except]p1:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
For unordered associative containers, no <tt>clear()</tt> function
throws an exception. <del>No</del> <tt>erase(<ins>k</ins>)</tt>
<del>function</del> <ins>does not</ins> throw<del>s</del> an exception
unless that exception is thrown by the container's Hash or Pred object
(if any).
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Change 23.2 [container.requirements] p10 to add references to new sections:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Unless otherwise specified (see [deque.modifiers]<ins>,</ins>
<del>and</del> [vector.modifiers]<ins>, [associative.req.except],
[unord.req.except]</ins>) all container types defined in this clause meet
the following additional requirements:
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Change 23.2 [container.requirements] p10 referring to <tt>swap</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
no <tt>swap()</tt> function throws an exception<del> unless that exception is thrown
by the copy constructor or assignment operator of the container's
Compare object (if any; see [associative.reqmts])</del>.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
