<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>In 23.3.8.2 [deque.cons] paragraph 6, the deque ctor that takes an iterator range appears
to have complexity requirements which are incorrect, and which contradict the
complexity requirements for insert(). I suspect that the text in question,
below, was taken from vector:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Complexity: If the iterators first and last are forward iterators,
  bidirectional iterators, or random access iterators the constructor makes only
  N calls to the copy constructor, and performs no reallocations, where N is
  last - first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word &quot;reallocations&quot; does not really apply to deque. Further,
all of the following appears to be spurious:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It makes at most 2N calls to the copy constructor of T and log N
  reallocations if they are input iterators.1)</p>
  <p>1) The complexity is greater in the case of input iterators because each
  element must be added individually: it is impossible to determine the distance
  between first abd last before doing the copying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes perfect sense for vector, but not for deque. Why should deque gain
an efficiency advantage from knowing in advance the number of elements to
insert?</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>In 23.3.8.2 [deque.cons] paragraph 6, replace the Complexity description, including the
footnote, with the following text (which also corrects the &quot;abd&quot;
typo):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Complexity: Makes last - first calls to the copy constructor of T.</p>
</blockquote>
