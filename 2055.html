<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The C++0x draft says <tt>std::accumulate</tt> uses: <tt>acc = binary_op(acc, *i)</tt>.
<p/>
Eelis van der Weegen has pointed out, on the libstdc++ mailing list, that using 
<tt>acc = binary_op(std::move(acc), *i)</tt> can lead to massive improvements (particularly, 
it means accumulating strings is linear rather than quadratic).
<p/>
Consider the simple case, accumulating a bunch of strings of length 1 (the same argument holds for other length buffers).
For strings <tt>s</tt> and <tt>t</tt>, <tt>s+t</tt> takes time <tt>length(s)+length(t)</tt>, as you have to copy 
both <tt>s</tt> and <tt>t</tt> into a new buffer.
<p/>
So in accumulating <tt>n</tt> strings, step <tt>i</tt> adds a string of length <tt>i-1</tt> to a string of length 
1, so takes time <tt>i</tt>.
<p/>
Therefore the total time taken is: <tt>1+2+3+...+n</tt> = O(<tt>n<sup>2</sup></tt>)
<p/>
<tt>std::move(s)+t</tt>, for a "good" implementation, is amortized time <tt>length(t)</tt>, like <tt>vector</tt>, 
just copy <tt>t</tt> onto the end of the buffer. So the total time taken is:
<p/>
<tt>1+1+1+...+1</tt> (<tt>n</tt> times) = O(<tt>n</tt>). This is the same as <tt>push_back</tt> on a <tt>vector</tt>.
<p/>
I'm trying to decide if this implementation might already be allowed. I suspect it might not 
be (although I can't imagine any sensible code it would break). There are other algorithms 
which could benefit similarly (<tt>inner_product</tt>, <tt>partial_sum</tt> and 
<tt>adjacent_difference</tt> are the most obvious).
<p/>
Is there any general wording for "you can use rvalues of temporaries"?
<p/>
The reflector discussion starting with message c++std-lib-29763 came to the conclusion
that above example is not covered by the "as-if" rules and that enabling this behaviour
would seem quite useful.

<p>
Moved to NAD Future.  This would be a larger change than we would consider for a simple TC.

<p><i>[2017-02 in Kona, LEWG responds]</i></p>

<p>Like the goal.</p>
<p>What is broken by adding std::move() on the non-binary-op version?</p>
<p>A different overload might be selected, and that would be a breakage. Is it breakage that we should care about?</p>
<p>We need to encourage value semantics.</p>
<p>Need a paper. What guidance do we give?</p>
<p>Use std::reduce() (uses generalized sum) instead of accumulate which doesn&rsquo;t suffer it.</p>
<p>Inner_product and adjacent_difference also. adjacent_difference solves it half-way for &ldquo;val&rdquo; object, but misses the opportunity for passing acc as <tt>std::move(acc)</tt>.</p>

<p><i>[2017-06-02 Issues Telecon]</i></p>

<p>Ville to encourage Eelis to write a paper on the algorithms in &lt;numeric&gt;, not just for accumulate.</p>
<p>Howard pointed out that this has already been done for the algorithms in &lt;algorithm&gt;</p>
<p>Status to Open; Priority 3</p>
</p>

<p><i>[2017-11-11, Albuquerque]</i></p>

<p>This was resolved by the adoption of <a href="http://wg21.link/P0616">P0616r0</a>.</p>
