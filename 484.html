<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>From comp.std.c++:</p>

<p>
I note that given an input iterator a for type <code>T</code>, 
then <code>*a</code> only has to be "convertable to <code>T</code>", 
not actually of type <code>T</code>.
</p>

<p>Firstly, I can't seem to find an exact definition of "convertable to <code>T</code>". 
While I assume it is the obvious definition (an implicit conversion), I 
can't find an exact definition. Is there one?</p>

<p>Slightly more worryingly, there doesn't seem to be any restriction on 
the this type, other than it is "convertable to <code>T</code>". Consider two input 
iterators <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. I would personally assume that most people would 
expect <code>*a==*b</code> would perform <code>T(*a)==T(*b)</code>, however it doesn't seem that 
the standard requires that, and that whatever type <code>*a</code> is (call it <code>U</code>) 
could have == defined on it with totally different symantics and still 
be a valid inputer iterator.</p>

<p>Is this a correct reading? When using input iterators should I write 
<code>T(*a)</code> all over the place to be sure that the object I'm using is the 
class I expect?</p>

<p>This is especially a nuisance for operations that are defined to be
  "convertible to <code>bool</code>".  (This is probably allowed so that
  implementations could return say an <code>int</code> and avoid an unnecessary
  conversion. However all implementations I have seen simply return a
  <code>bool</code> anyway.  Typical implementations of STL algorithms just write
  things like <code>while(a!=b &amp;&amp; *a!=0)</code>.  But strictly
  speaking, there are lots of types that are convertible to <code>T</code> but
  that also overload the appropriate operators so this doesn't behave
  as expected.</p>

<p>If we want to make code like this legal (which most people seem to
  expect), then we'll need to tighten up what we mean by "convertible
  to <code>T</code>".</p>

<p><i>[Lillehammer: The first part is NAD, since "convertible" is
 well-defined in core. The second part is basically about pathological
 overloads. It's a minor problem but a real one. So leave open for
 now, hope we solve it as part of iterator redesign.]</i></p>

<p><i>[2017-02 in Kona, LEWG recommends NAD]</i></p>

<p>Has been clarified by 14. By design. Ranges might make it go away. 
Current wording for input iterators is more constrained.</p>

<p><i>[2017-06-02 Issues Telecon]</i></p>

<p>Move to Open. This is very similar to <a href="2962" title="Iterators of Containers of move-only types do not model InputIterator (Status: Open)">2962</a>, possibly a duplicate.</p>

<p><i>[2017-07 Toronto Thurs Issue Prioritization]</i></p>

<p>Priority 2; same as <a href="2962" title="Iterators of Containers of move-only types do not model InputIterator (Status: Open)">2962</a>.</p>

<p>
During LWG discussion of this issue it was decided to reduce the priority to 3.
<p/>
Furthermore, the still presented "Solved by" comment has been recognized as being
no longer true, since the referred to pre-C++11 concept paper wording <a href="https://wg21.link/N2758">N2758</a> is no longer part
of the working paper.
<p/>
It also has been observed, that the "convertible to <code>bool</code>" part has since been resolved
by <a href="https://wg21.link/P1964">P1964</a> and the follow-up paper <a href="https://wg21.link/P2167">P2167</a>.
<p/>
Also LWG <a href="3105" title="T1 is convertible to T2 (Status: New)">3105</a> has a lot of overlap with this issue.
