<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>From comp.std.c++:</p>

<p>
I note that given an input iterator a for type <tt>T</tt>, 
then <tt>*a</tt> only has to be "convertable to <tt>T</tt>", 
not actually of type <tt>T</tt>.
</p>

<p>Firstly, I can't seem to find an exact definition of "convertable to <tt>T</tt>". 
While I assume it is the obvious definition (an implicit conversion), I 
can't find an exact definition. Is there one?</p>

<p>Slightly more worryingly, there doesn't seem to be any restriction on 
the this type, other than it is "convertable to <tt>T</tt>". Consider two input 
iterators <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>. I would personally assume that most people would 
expect <tt>*a==*b</tt> would perform <tt>T(*a)==T(*b)</tt>, however it doesn't seem that 
the standard requires that, and that whatever type <tt>*a</tt> is (call it <tt>U</tt>) 
could have == defined on it with totally different symantics and still 
be a valid inputer iterator.</p>

<p>Is this a correct reading? When using input iterators should I write 
<tt>T(*a)</tt> all over the place to be sure that the object I'm using is the 
class I expect?</p>

<p>This is especially a nuisance for operations that are defined to be
  "convertible to <tt>bool</tt>".  (This is probably allowed so that
  implementations could return say an <tt>int</tt> and avoid an unnessary
  conversion. However all implementations I have seen simply return a
  <tt>bool</tt> anyway.  Typical implemtations of STL algorithms just write
  things like <tt>while(a!=b &amp;&amp; *a!=0)</tt>.  But strictly
  speaking, there are lots of types that are convertible to <tt>T</tt> but
  that also overload the appropriate operators so this doesn't behave
  as expected.</p>

<p>If we want to make code like this legal (which most people seem to
  expect), then we'll need to tighten up what we mean by "convertible
  to <tt>T</tt>".</p>

<p><i>[Lillehammer: The first part is NAD, since "convertible" is
 well-defined in core. The second part is basically about pathological
 overloads. It's a minor problem but a real one. So leave open for
 now, hope we solve it as part of iterator redesign.]</i></p>
