<p>
Currently, <tt>std::experimental::optional::operator==</tt> imposes the <tt>EqualityComparable</tt> requirement which provides
two guarantees: It ensures that <tt>operator!=</tt> can rely on the equivalence-relation property and more importantly, that
the <tt>BooleanTestable</tt> requirements suggested by issue <a href="2114">2114</a> are automatically implied.
<p/>
<tt>std::experimental::optional::operator&lt;</tt> doesn't provide a <tt>LessThanComparable</tt> requirement, but there was quite
an historic set of changes involved with that family of types: As of 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3527.html">N3527</a>
this operator was defined in terms of <tt>operator&lt;</tt> of the contained type <tt>T</tt> and imposed the <tt>LessThanComparable</tt> 
requirement. In the final acceptance step of <tt>optional</tt> by the committee, the definition was expressed in terms of <tt>std::less</tt>
and the <tt>LessThanComparable</tt> requirement had been removed.
<p/>
The inconsistency between <tt>operator==</tt> and <tt>operator&lt;</tt> should be removed. One possible course of action would be 
to add the <tt>LessThanComparable</tt> to <tt>std::experimental::optional::operator&lt;</tt>. The <tt>EqualityComparable</tt> requirement
of <tt>operator==</tt> could also be removed, but in that case both operators would at least need to require the <tt>BooleanTestable</tt> 
requirements (see <a href="2114">2114</a>) for the result type of <tt>T</tt>'s <tt>operator==</tt> and <tt>operator&lt;</tt>. 
<p/>
Arguably, corresponding operators for <tt>pair</tt> and <tt>tuple</tt> do not impose <tt>LessThanComparable</tt> (nor
<tt>EqualityComparable</tt>), albeit the definition of the "derived" relation functions depend on properties ensured by
<tt>LessThanComparable</tt>. According to the <a href="https://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/pair.html">SGI definition</a>, the intention was
to imposed both <tt>EqualityComparable</tt> and <tt>LessThanComparable</tt>. If this is not intended, the standard should clarify
this position.

<p>
VV, DK, JY discuss why and when <tt>LessThanComparable</tt> was removed. AM: Move to LEWG. Please tell LWG when you look at it.
