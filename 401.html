<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
I think that in par2 of  [default.con.req] the last two
lines of table 32 contain two incorrect type casts. The lines are ...
</p>

<pre>
  a.construct(p,t)   Effect: new((void*)p) T(t)
  a.destroy(p)       Effect: ((T*)p)?-&gt;~T()
</pre>

<p>
.... with the prerequisits coming from the preceding two paragraphs, especially
from table 31:
</p>

<pre>
  alloc&lt;T&gt;             a     ;// an allocator for T
  alloc&lt;T&gt;::pointer    p     ;// random access iterator
                              // (may be different from T*)
  alloc&lt;T&gt;::reference  r = *p;// T&amp;
  T const&amp;             t     ;
</pre>

<p>
For that two type casts ("(void*)p" and "(T*)p") to be well-formed
this would require then conversions to T* and void* for all
alloc&lt;T&gt;::pointer, so it would implicitely introduce extra
requirements for alloc&lt;T&gt;::pointer, additionally to the only
current requirement (being a random access iterator).
</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>

<p>
Accept proposed wording from
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2436.pdf">N2436</a> part 1.
</p>

<p>
Note: Actually I would prefer to replace "((T*)p)?-&gt;dtor_name" with
"p?-&gt;dtor_name", but AFAICS this is not possible cause of an omission
in 13.5.6 [over.ref] (for which I have filed another DR on 29.11.2002).

<p><i>[Kona: The LWG thinks this is somewhere on the border between
  Open and NAD.  The intend is clear: <tt>construct</tt> constructs an
  object at the location <i>p</i>.  It's reading too much into the
  description to think that literally calling <tt>new</tt> is
  required.  Tweaking this description is low priority until we can do
  a thorough review of allocators, and, in particular, allocators with
  non-default pointer types.]</i></p>


<p><i>[
Batavia:  Proposed resolution changed to less code and more description.

<p><i>[
post Oxford:  This would be rendered NAD Editorial by acceptance of
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2257.html">N2257</a>.
]</i></p>


<p><i>[
Kona (2007): The LWG adopted the proposed resolution of N2387 for this issue which
was subsequently split out into a separate paper N2436 for the purposes of voting.
The resolution in N2436 addresses this issue.  The LWG voted to accelerate this
issue to Ready status to be voted into the WP at Kona.
