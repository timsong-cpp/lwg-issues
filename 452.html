<pre>
template&lt;class Facet>
    locale::combine(const locale&amp;) const;
</pre>
<p>
is obliged to create a locale that has no name. This is overspecification
and overkill. The resulting locale should follow the usual rules -- it
has a name if the locale argument has a name and Facet is one of the
standard facets.
</p>

<p><i>[
 Sydney and post-Sydney (see c++std-lib-13439, c++std-lib-13440,
 c++std-lib-13443): agreed that it's overkill to say that the locale
 is obligated to be nameless.  However, we also can't require it to
 have a name.  At the moment, locale names are based on categories
 and not on individual facets.  If a locale contains two different
 facets of different names from the same category, then this would
 not fit into existing naming schemes.  We need to give
 implementations more freedom.  Bill will provide wording.
]</i></p>




<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>After further discussion the LWG decided to close this as NAD.
  The fundamental problem is that names right now are per-category,
  not per-facet.  The <tt>combine</tt> member function works at the
  wrong level of granularity.</p>
