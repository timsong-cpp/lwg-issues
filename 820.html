<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
As of N2521, the Working Paper appears to be silent about what
<tt>current_exception()</tt> should do if it tries to copy the currently handled
exception and its copy constructor throws.  21.9.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/propagation">[propagation]</a>/7 says "If the
function needs to allocate memory and the attempt fails, it returns an
<tt>exception_ptr</tt> object that refers to an instance of <tt>bad_alloc</tt>.", but
doesn't say anything about what should happen if memory allocation
succeeds but the actual copying fails.
</p>

<p>
I see three alternatives: (1) return an <tt>exception_ptr</tt> object that refers
to an instance of some fixed exception type, (2) return an <tt>exception_ptr</tt>
object that refers to an instance of the copy ctor's thrown exception
(but if that has a throwing copy ctor, an infinite loop can occur), or
(3) call <tt>terminate()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
I believe that <tt>terminate()</tt> is the most reasonable course of action, but
before we go implement that, I wanted to raise this issue.
</p>

<p><i>[
Peter's summary:
]</i></p>


<blockquote>
<p>
The current practice is to not have throwing copy constructors in
exception classes, because this can lead to <tt>terminate()</tt> as described in
18.5.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/except.terminate">[except.terminate]</a>. Thus calling <tt>terminate()</tt> in this situation seems
consistent and does not introduce any new problems.
</p>

<p>
However, the resolution of core issue 475 may relax this requirement:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The CWG agreed with the position that <tt>std::uncaught_exception()</tt> should
return <tt>false</tt> during the copy to the exception object and that <tt>std::terminate()</tt>
should not be called if that constructor exits with an exception.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Since throwing copy constructors will no longer call <tt>terminate()</tt>, option
(3) doesn't seem reasonable as it is deemed too drastic a response in a
recoverable situation.
</p>

<p>
Option (2) cannot be adopted by itself, because a potential infinite
recursion will need to be terminated by one of the other options.
</p>

</blockquote>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
Add the following paragraph after 21.9.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/propagation">[propagation]</a>/7:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Returns (continued):</i> If the attempt to copy the current exception
object throws an exception, the function returns an <tt>exception_ptr</tt> that
refers to the thrown exception or, if this is not possible, to an
instance of <tt>bad_exception</tt>.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Note:</i> The copy constructor of the thrown exception may also fail, so
the implementation is allowed to substitute a <tt>bad_exception</tt> to avoid
infinite recursion. <i>-- end note.</i>]
</p>
</blockquote>



<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p><i>[
San Francisco:
]</i></p>


<blockquote>
<p>
Pete: there may be an implied assumption in the proposed wording that
current_exception() copies the existing exception object; the
implementation may not actually do that.
</p>
<p>
Pete will make the required editorial tweaks to rectify this.
</p>
