<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Right now, the <tt>compare_exchange_weak</tt> loop should rapidly converge on the
padding contents. But <tt>compare_exchange_strong</tt> will require a bit more
compiler work to ignore padding for comparison purposes.
</p>
<p>
Note that this isn't a problem for structs with no padding, and we do
already have one portable way to ensure that there is no padding that
covers the key use cases: Have elements be the same type. I suspect that
the greatest need is for a structure of two pointers, which has no
padding problem. I suspect the second need is a structure of a pointer
and some form of an integer. If that integer is <tt>intptr_t</tt>, there will be
no padding.
</p>
<p>
Related but separable issue: For unused bitfields, or other unused
fields for that matter, we should probably say it's the programmer's
responsibility to set them to zero or otherwise ensure they'll be
ignored by <tt>memcmp</tt>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Proposed resolution:</b> Using
<tt>atomic&lt;struct-with-padding&gt;::compare_exchange_strong</tt> should be either:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
ill-formed, or
</li>
<li>
well-defined.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I propose Option 1 for C++0x for expediency, though I'm not sure how to
say it. I would be happy with Option 2, which I believe would mean that
<tt>compare_exchange_strong</tt> would be implemented to avoid comparing padding
bytes, or something equivalent such as always zeroing out padding when
loading/storing/comparing. (Either implementation might require compiler
support.)

Move to open. Blocked until concepts for atomics are addressed.
