<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>The issue is this: Must the elements of a vector be in contiguous memory?</p>

<p>(Please note that this is entirely separate from the question of
whether a vector iterator is required to be a pointer; the answer to
that question is clearly &quot;no,&quot; as it would rule out
debugging implementations)</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>Add the following text to the end of 23.3.11 [vector],
paragraph 1. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The elements of a vector are stored contiguously, meaning that if
  v is a <tt>vector&lt;T, Allocator&gt;</tt> where T is some type
  other than <tt>bool</tt>, then it obeys the identity <tt>&amp;v[n]
  == &amp;v[0] + n</tt> for all <tt>0 &lt;= n &lt; v.size()</tt>.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>The LWG feels that as a practical matter the answer is clearly
&quot;yes&quot;.  There was considerable discussion as to the best way
to express the concept of &quot;contiguous&quot;, which is not
directly defined in the standard.  Discussion included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An operational definition similar to the above proposed resolution is 
    already used for valarray (26.7.2.4 [valarray.access]).</li>
  <li>There is no need to explicitly consider a user-defined operator&amp; 
    because elements must be copyconstructible (23.2 [container.requirements] para 3) 
    and copyconstructible (17.6.3.1 [utility.arg.requirements]) specifies
    requirements for operator&amp;.</li>
  <li>There is no issue of one-past-the-end because of language rules.</li>
</ul>
