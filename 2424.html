<p>
Otherwise, one could use <tt>memcpy</tt> to save and restore the value according to 3.9p2.
<p/>
It seems the core language rules in 9 [class]p6 with 12.8 [class.copy]p12 
(trivial copy constructor) etc. and 8.4.2 [dcl.fct.def.default]p5 (user-provided) say 
that the atomic types are trivially copyable, which is bad. We shouldn't rely on future core 
changes in that area and simply say in the library section 29.5 [atomics.types.generic] 
that these very special types are not trivially copyable.
</p>

<p><i>[2014-11 Urbana]</i></p>

<p>
Lawrence:Definition of "trivially copyable" has been changing.
</p>
<p>
Doesn't hurt to add proposed change, even if the sentence is redundant
</p>
<p>
Move to Review.

<p><i>[2015-02 Cologne]</i></p>

<p>
GR has a minor problem with the style of the wording. VV has major issues with implementability.
</p>

<p><i>[2015-03-22, Jens Maurer responses to Cologne discussion]</i></p>

<p>
A library implementation could provide a partial specialization for <tt>is_trivially_copyable&lt;atomic&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt>, 
to ensure that any such type query would return <tt>false</tt>.
<p/>
Assuming such a specialization would be provided, how could a conforming program observe that per 
language rules an <tt>atomic</tt> specialization would actually be trivially copyable if there 
is no way to call the (deleted) copy constructor or copy assignment operator?
<p/>
The sole effect of the suggested addition of the constraining sentence is that it would make a user program
non-conforming that attempts to invoke <tt>memcpy</tt> (and the like) on <tt>atomic</tt> types, since that
would invoke undefined behaviour.
</p>

<p><i>[2015-05 Lenexa, SG1 response]</i></p>

<p>
SG1 is fine with P/R (and agrees it's needed), but LWG may want to
check the details; it's not entirely an SG1 issue.
</p>

<p><i>[2015-05-05 Lenexa]</i></p>

<p>Marshall: This was discussed on the telecon. Alisdair was going to write something to Mike and send it to Core.</p>
<p>Hwrd: Core says that deleted copies are trivially copyable, which makes no sense to Library people.</p>
<p>STL: There doesn't appear to be a Core issue about it.</p>

<p><i>[2015-09-11 Telecom]</i></p>

<p>Howard: currently std::is_trivially_copyable&lt;std::atomic&gt; is true, so this resolution would contradict reality</p>
<p>Jonathan: changing that is good, we don't want it to be trivially copyable, otherwise users can memcpy them, which we really don't want</p>
<p>Howard: is it reasonable to memcpy something that isn't trivially copy constructible or trivially assignable?</p>
<p>Jonathan: no, it's not, but Core says you can, so this resolution is needed to stop people memcpying atomic</p>
<p>Howard: we should fix the core rule</p>
<p>Marshall: there is a separate issue of whether trivially-copyable makes sense, but this resolution is a net good purely because it stops memcpy of atomics</p>
<p>Howard: so should implementations specialize is_trivially_copyable the trait to meet this?</p>
<p>Jonathan: or add an empty, user-defined destructor.</p>
<p>Howard: should the spec specify that then?</p>
<p>Over-specification.</p>
<p>Howard: without that I fear implementation divergence.</p>
<p>Ville and Jonathan to investigate potential implementation options.</p>
<p>Ville: request a note on the issue saying we need review other types such as condition_variable to see if they are also unintentionally trivially-copyable. N4460 mentions some such types.</p>

<p><i>[2016-03 Jacksonville]</i></p>

<p>
We think there is something coming from Core to resolve that, and that this will be NAD.<br/>
Until then, defer. <br/>
</p>

<p><i>[2016-03 Jacksonville]</i></p>

<p>This was resolved by Core Issue 1496</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Change 29.5 [atomics.types.generic]p3 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Specializations and instantiations of the <tt>atomic</tt> template shall have a deleted copy constructor, a deleted
copy assignment operator, and a constexpr value constructor. <ins>They are not trivially copyable 
types (3.9 [basic.types]).</ins>
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
