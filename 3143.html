<p>
During the discussion of LWG <a href="3120">3120</a> it was pointed out that the current
wording in 20.12.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/mem.res.monotonic.buffer">[mem.res.monotonic.buffer]</a> is contradictory. The introductory text for 
the class says "Each additional buffer is larger than the previous one, following 
a geometric progression" but the spec for <tt>do_allocate</tt> doesn't agree.
<p/>
Firstly, it's impossible for the implementation to ensure a single geometric progression, 
because the size of the next buffer can be arbitrarily large. If the caller asks for an 
allocation that is <tt>N</tt> times bigger than the previous buffer, the next buffer will be at
least <tt>N</tt> times larger than the previous one. If <tt>N</tt> is larger than the
implementation-defined growth factor it's not a geometric progression.
<p/>
Secondly, it's not even clear that each additional buffer will be larger than the previous one. 
Given a <tt>monotonic_buffer_resource</tt> object with little remaining space in <tt>current_buffer</tt>, 
a request to allocate <tt>10*next_buffer_size</tt> will:
<p/>
"set <tt>current_buffer</tt> to <tt>upstream_rsrc-&gt;allocate(n, m)</tt>, where <tt>n</tt> is not
less than <tt>max(bytes, next_buffer_size)</tt> and <tt>m</tt> is not less than <tt>alignment</tt>, 
and increase <tt>next_buffer_size</tt> by an implementation-defined growth factor (which need not 
be integral), then allocate the return block from the newly-allocated <tt>current_buffer</tt>."
<p/>
The effects are to allocate a new buffer of at least <tt>max(10*next_buffer_size, next_buffer_size)</tt> 
bytes, and then do <tt>next_buffer_size *= growth_factor</tt>. If <tt>growth_factor &lt; 10</tt> then 
the next allocated buffer might be smaller than the last one. This means that although 
<tt>next_buffer_size</tt> itself follows a geometric progression, the actual size of any single 
allocated buffer can be much larger than <tt>next_buffer_size</tt>. A graph of the allocated sizes looks 
like a geometric progression with spikes where an allocation size is larger than <tt>next_buffer_size</tt>.
<p/>
If the intention is to set <tt>next_buffer_size = max(n, next_buffer_size * growth_factor)</tt> so 
that every allocation from upstream is larger than the previous one, then we need a change to the 
<i>Effects:</i> to actually say that. Rather than a geometric progression with anomalous spikes,
this would produce a number of different geometric progressions with discontinuous jumps between them.
<p/>
If the spiky interpretation is right then we need to weaken the "Each additional buffer is larger" 
statement. Either way, we need to add a caveat to the "following a geometric progression" text 
because that isn't true for the spiky interpretation or the jumpy interpretation.
<p/>
Thirdly, the <i>Effects:</i> says that the size of the allocated block, <tt>n</tt>, is not less than 
<tt>max(bytes, next_buffer_size)</tt>. This seems to allow an implementation to choose to do 
<tt>n = ceil2(max(bytes, next_buffer_size))</tt> if it wishes (maybe because allocating sizes that 
are a power of 2 simplifies the <tt>monotonic_buffer_resource</tt> implementation, or allows reducing 
the bookkeeping overhead). This still results in an approximate geometric progression (under either 
the spiky or jumpy interpretation) but the graph has steps rather than being a smooth curve (but 
always above the curve). This is another way that "Each additional buffer is larger than the previous 
one" is not guaranteed. Even if <tt>max(bytes, next_buffer_size)</tt> is greater on every call, for a
growth factor between <tt>1.0</tt> and <tt>2.0</tt> the result of <tt>ceil2</tt> might be the same 
for two successive buffers. I see no reason to forbid this, but Pablo suggested it's not allowed 
because it doesn't result in exponential growth (which I disagree with). If this is supposed to be
forbidden, the wording needs to be fixed to forbid it.
