<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Today, my colleagues and me wasted a lot of time. After some time, I
found the problem. It could be reduced to the following short example:
</p>

<pre>
  #include &lt;string&gt;
  int main() { std::string( 0 ); }
</pre>

<p>The problem is that the tested compilers (GCC 2.95.2, GCC 3.3.1 and
Comeau online) compile the above without errors or warnings! The
programs (at least for the GCC) resulted in a SEGV.</p>

<p>I know that the standard explicitly states that the ctor of string
requires a <tt>char*</tt> which is not zero. STLs could easily detect the above
case with a private ctor for <tt>basic_string</tt> which takes a single '<tt>int</tt>'
argument. This would catch the above code at compile time and would not
ambiguate any other legal ctors.</p>

<p><i>[Redmond: No great enthusiasm for doing this.  If we do,
  however, we want to do it for all places that take <tt>charT*</tt>
  pointers, not just the single-argument constructor.  The other
  question is whether we want to catch this at compile time (in which
  case we catch the error of a literal 0, but not an expression whose
  value is a null pointer), at run time, or both.
  Recommend NAD.  Relegate this functionality to debugging implementations.]</i></p>

designed to solve exactly this kind of problem.

<blockquote><p>
We are unable to achieve consensus on an approach to a resolution.
There is some sentiment for treating this as a QOI matter.
It is also possible
that when <tt>string</tt> is brought into the concepts world,
this issue might be addressed in that context.

<blockquote>
<p>
We considered three options:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The proposed resolution.</li>
<li>NAD</li>
<li>Interpret a null pointer as the empty string.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The consensus was NAD.
</p>

<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
Add to the synopsis in 21.3.1 [basic.string]
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
<ins>basic_string( nullptr_t ) = delete;</ins>
</pre></blockquote>
