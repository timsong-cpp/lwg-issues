<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>The description of iter_swap in 25.2.2 paragraph 7,says that it
``exchanges the values'' of the objects to which two iterators
refer.<br/> <br/> What it doesn't say is whether it does so using swap
or using the assignment operator and copy constructor.<br/> <br/> This
question is an important one to answer, because swap is specialized to
work efficiently for standard containers.<br/> For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>vector&lt;int&gt; v1, v2;
iter_swap(&amp;v1, &amp;v2);</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this call to iter_swap equivalent to calling swap(v1, v2)?&nbsp;
Or is it equivalent to</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>{
vector&lt;int&gt; temp = v1;
v1 = v2;
v2 = temp;
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The first alternative is O(1); the second is O(n).</p>
<p>A LWG member, Dave Abrahams, comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not an objection necessarily, but I want to point out the cost of
that requirement:</p>
  <blockquote>
<p><tt>iter_swap(list&lt;T&gt;::iterator, list&lt;T&gt;::iterator)</tt></p>
  </blockquote>
<p>can currently be specialized to be more efficient than
iter_swap(T*,T*) for many T (by using splicing). Your proposal would
make that optimization illegal.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>[Kona: The LWG notes the original need for iter_swap was proxy iterators
which are no longer permitted.]</i></p>



<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>Change the effect clause of iter_swap in 25.2.2 paragraph 7 from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exchanges the values pointed to by the two iterators a and b.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to</p>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>swap(*a, *b)</tt>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>It's useful to say just what <tt>iter_swap</tt> does.  There may be
  some iterators for which we want to specialize <tt>iter_swap</tt>,
  but the fully general version should have a general specification.</p>

<p>Note that in the specific case of <tt>list&lt;T&gt;::iterator</tt>,
iter_swap should not be specialized as suggested above.  That would do
much more than exchanging the two iterators' values: it would change
predecessor/successor relationships, possibly moving the iterator from
one list to another.  That would surely be inappropriate.</p>
