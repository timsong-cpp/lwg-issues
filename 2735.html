<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Consider this C++98 program:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;

int main() {
  return std::abs(static_cast&lt;short&gt;(23)) % 42;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This works fine with C++98 compilers. At the <tt>std::abs(short)</tt> call, short gets promoted to <tt>int</tt> and 
<tt>std::abs(int)</tt> is called.
<p/>
C++11 added the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/n4594.pdf">following wording</a>
on page 1083 &sect;26.9 p15 b2 [c.math]:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Otherwise, if any argument of arithmetic type corresponding to a <tt>double</tt> parameter has type <tt>double</tt> 
or an integer type, then all arguments of arithmetic type corresponding to <tt>double</tt> parameters are effectively 
cast to <tt>double</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
C++17 draft <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/n4594.pdf">additionally adds</a> on
page 1080 &sect;26.9 p10 [c.math]:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If <tt>abs()</tt> is called with an argument of type <tt>X</tt> for which <tt>is_unsigned&lt;X&gt;::value</tt> is <tt>true</tt> 
and if <tt>X</tt> cannot be converted to <tt>int</tt> by integral promotion (4.5), the program is ill-formed. [<i>Note:</i> 
Arguments that can be promoted to <tt>int</tt> are permitted for compatibility with C. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is somewhat confusing and probably even contradictory to on the one hand specify <tt>abs()</tt> in terms of integral 
promotion in &sect;26.9 p10 and on the other hand demand all integral types to be converted to <tt>double</tt> in 
&sect;26.9 p15 b2.
<p/>
Most compilers (each with their own respective library implementation) I tested (MSVC, Clang, older GCC) appear to not 
consider &sect;26.9 p15 b2 for <tt>std::abs</tt> and compile the code successfully. GCC 4.5-5.3 (for <tt>std::abs</tt> but 
not for <tt>::abs</tt>) as well as GCC &gt;=6.0 (for both <tt>std::abs</tt> and <tt>::abs</tt>) fail to compile in the following 
way: Taking &sect;26.9 p15 b2 literally and applying it to <tt>abs()</tt> (which is listed in &sect;26.9 p12) results in 
<tt>abs(short)</tt> returning <tt>double</tt>, and with <tt>operator%</tt> not being specified for <tt>double</tt>, this 
makes the programm ill-formed.
<p/>
I do acknowledge the reason for the wording and semantics demanded by &sect;26.9 p15 b2, i.e. being able to call math functions 
with integral types or with partly floating point types and partly integral types. Converting integral types to <tt>double</tt>
certainly makes sense here for all the other floating point math functions.
However, <tt>abs()</tt> is special. <tt>abs()</tt> has overloads for the 3 wider integral types which return integral types. 
<tt>abs()</tt> originates in the C standard in <tt>stdlib.h</tt> and had originally been specified for integral types only. 
Calling it in C with a short argument returns an <tt>int</tt>. Calling <tt>std::abs(short)</tt> in C++98 also returns an 
<tt>int</tt>. Calling <tt>std::abs(short)</tt> in C++11 and later with &sect;26.9 p15 b2 applied to <tt>abs()</tt> suddenly 
returns a <tt>double</tt>.
<p/>
Additionally, this behaviour also breaks third-party C headers which contain macros or inline functions calling 
<tt>abs(short)</tt>.
<p/>
As per discussion on std-discussion, my reading of the standard as well as GCC's interpretation seem valid.
However, as can be seen, this breaks existing code.
<p/>
In addition to the compatibilty concerns, having <tt>std::abs(short)</tt> return <tt>double</tt> is also very confusing 
and unintuitive.
<p/>
The other (possibly, depending on their respective size relative to <tt>int</tt>) affected types besides <tt>short</tt> 
are <tt>signed char</tt>, <tt>unsigned char</tt> and <tt>unsigned short</tt>, and also <tt>char</tt>, <tt>char16_t</tt>, 
<tt>char32_t</tt> and <tt>wchar_t</tt>, (all of these are or may be promotable to <tt>int</tt>). Wider integral types 
are not affected because explicit overloads are specified for those types by &sect;26.9 p6, &sect;26.9 p7 and &sect;26.9 p9.
<tt>div()</tt> is also not affected because it is neither listed in &sect;26.9 p12, nor does it actually provide 
any overload for <tt>double</tt> at all.
<p/>
As far as I can see, the proposed or implemented solutions for LWG <a href="lwg-active.html#2294">2294</a>, <a href="lwg-defects.html#2192">2192</a> and/or 
<a href="lwg-defects.html#2086">2086</a> do not resolve this issue.
<p/>
I think both, &sect;26.9 p10 [c.math] and &sect;26.9 p15 [c.math] need some correction and clarification.
<p/>
(Note: These changes would explicitly render the current implementation in GCC's libstdc++ non-conforming, which would 
be a good thing, as outlined above.)
