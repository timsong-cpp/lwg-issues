<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>As written, ios_base has a copy constructor and an assignment
operator. (Nothing in the standard says it doesn't have one, and all
classes have copy constructors and assignment operators unless you
take specific steps to avoid them.) However, nothing in 27.4.2 says
what the copy constructor and assignment operator do. </p>

<p>My guess is that this was an oversight, that ios_base is, like
basic_ios, not supposed to have a copy constructor or an assignment
operator.</p>

<p>
Jerry Schwarz comments: Yes, its an oversight, but in the opposite
sense to what you're suggesting. At one point there was a definite
intention that you could copy ios_base. It's an easy way to save the
entire state of a stream for future use. As you note, to carry out
that intention would have required a explicit description of the
semantics (e.g. what happens to the iarray and parray stuff).
</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>In 27.5.3 [ios.base], class ios_base, specify the copy
constructor and operator= members as being private.</p>


<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>The LWG believes the difficulty of specifying correct semantics
outweighs any benefit of allowing ios_base objects to be copyable.</p>
