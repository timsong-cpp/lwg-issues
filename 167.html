<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>Paragraph 4 states that the length is determined using
<tt>traits::length(s)</tt>.  Unfortunately, this function is not
defined for example if the character type is <tt>wchar_t</tt> and the
type of <tt>s</tt> is <tt>char const*</tt>. Similar problems exist if
the character type is <tt>char</tt> and the type of <tt>s</tt> is
either <tt>signed char const*</tt> or <tt>unsigned char
const*</tt>.</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>Change 31.7.6.3.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/ostream.inserters.character">[ostream.inserters.character]</a> paragraph 4 from:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Effects: Behaves like an formatted inserter (as described in
  lib.ostream.formatted.reqmts) of out. After a sentry object is
  constructed it inserts characters. The number of characters starting
  at s to be inserted is traits::length(s). Padding is determined as
  described in lib.facet.num.put.virtuals. The traits::length(s)
  characters starting at s are widened using out.widen
  (lib.basic.ios.members). The widened characters and any required
  padding are inserted into out. Calls width(0).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Effects: Behaves like a formatted inserter (as described in
  lib.ostream.formatted.reqmts) of out. After a sentry object is
  constructed it inserts <i>n</i> characters starting at <i>s</i>,
  where <i>n</i> is the number that would be computed as if by:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>traits::length(s) for the overload where the first argument is of
    type basic_ostream&lt;charT, traits&gt;&amp; and the second is
    of type const charT*, and also for the overload where the first
    argument is of type basic_ostream&lt;char, traits&gt;&amp; and
    the second is of type const char*.</li>
  <li>std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;::length(s) 
    for the overload where the first argument is of type 
    basic_ostream&lt;charT, traits&gt;&amp; and the second is of type
    const char*.</li>
  <li>traits::length(reinterpret_cast&lt;const char*&gt;(s)) 
    for the other two overloads.</li>
  </ul>

  lib.facet.num.put.virtuals. The <i>n</i> characters starting at

<p><i>[Santa Cruz: Matt supplied new wording]</i></p>


<p><i>[Kona: changed "where <i>n</i> is" to " where <i>n</i> is the
  number that would be computed as if by"]</i></p>
 



<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>We have five separate cases.  In two of them we can use the
user-supplied traits class without any fuss.  In the other three we
try to use something as close to that user-supplied class as possible.
In two cases we've got a traits class that's appropriate for
char and what we've got is a const signed char* or a const
unsigned char*; that's close enough so we can just use a reinterpret
cast, and continue to use the user-supplied traits class.  Finally,
there's one case where we just have to give up: where we've got a
traits class for some arbitrary charT type, and we somehow have to
deal with a const char*.  There's nothing better to do but fall back
to char_traits&lt;char&gt;</p>
