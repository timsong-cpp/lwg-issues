<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
For C++11 we gave all of the containers, including basic_string new generalized pointer types:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
typedef typename allocator_traits&lt;Allocator&gt;::pointer       pointer:
typedef typename allocator_traits&lt;Allocator&gt;::const_pointer const_pointer;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
However, the constructors, assignment, and member functions still traffic exclusively in terms 
of <tt>const charT*</tt>, for example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
basic_string(const charT* s, const Allocator&amp; a = Allocator());
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Was this an oversight? Did we mean instead:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
basic_string(const_pointer s, const Allocator&amp; a = Allocator());
</pre></blockquote>

<p><b>Rationale:</b></p><p>
It's intentional. <tt>char_traits</tt> assumes that all elements of
a string can be accessed indirect on plain pointers. So <tt>basic_string</tt> 
doesn't support allocators with fancy pointers or references. And we meant 
to do that.
<p/>
Let's take the constructor example you called out:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
basic_string(const charT* s, const Allocator&amp; a = Allocator());
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This constructor allows us to create a <tt>basic_string</tt> object from a string literal.  
If we were to change the pointer type, that would no longer be possible.
<p/>
There is no issue here, as the implementation of the constructor must make a 
copy of the string pointed-to by the pointer 's' rather than adopt ownership of 
that buffer. It is that internal copy that must make use of the <tt>allocator::pointer</tt> type.
<p/>
Now what about the return value of '<tt>c_str()</tt>', should that return an <tt>allocator::pointer</tt>?
<p/>
Again, the answer (I believe) is 'no' because this is the function that allows us 
to pass the string's contents to a legacy&#47;OS 'C' API. It is deliberately returning 
a raw pointer for a reason.
<p/>
There was an issue where <tt>vector::data</tt> was changed to return an <tt>allocator::pointer</tt>
to the internal buffer, and this was changed back exactly because this was intended 
to support passing to external APIs.
<p/>
Do we have a use-case where the pointer type of internal data structures of our 
containers (notably <tt>basic_string</tt> and <tt>vector</tt>) need to be exposed through a public API?  
All my current use-cases for <tt>allocator::pointer</tt> are specific to the implementation 
of containers themselves.
