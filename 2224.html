<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
The standard currently does not discuss when library objects may be accessed, except in a non-normative 
note pertaining to synchronization in [res.on.objects], leaving it ambiguous whether single-threaded 
code can access a library object during its construction or destruction. For example, there is a 
reasonable question as to what happens if the deleter supplied to a <tt>unique_ptr</tt> transitively 
accesses the <tt>unique_ptr</tt> itself during <tt>unique_ptr</tt>'s destruction; a straightforward 
reading suggests that this is permitted, and that the deleter will see the <tt>unique_ptr</tt> still 
holding the originally stored pointer, but consensus on the LWG reflector indicates this was not the 
intent (see discussion beginning with 
<a href="http://accu.org/cgi-bin/wg21/message?wg=lib&amp;msg=33362">c++std-lib-33362</a>).

Geoffrey will provide an example that clearly highlights the issue.
</p>

<p><i>[2013-03-19 Geoffrey provides revised resolution and an example]</i></p>


<p>
I contend that the most straightforward reading of the current standard requires the following example code to print 
"good" (because <tt>~unique_ptr</tt> is not specified to modify the state of the internal pointer), but the consensus 
on the reflector was that its behavior should be undefined.
<p/>
This example also shows that, contrary to a comment in the telecon, the PR is not tautological. 12.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/class.cdtor">[class.cdtor]</a>/p4 
explicitly permits member function calls during destruction, so the behavior of this code is well-defined as far as 
the core language is concerned, despite the fact that it accesses a library object after the end of the object's 
lifetime. If we want this code to have undefined behavior, we need to specify that at the library level.
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;memory&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class A;

struct B {
 std::unique_ptr&lt;A&gt; a;
};

struct A {
 B* b;
 ~A() {
   if (b-&gt;a.get() == this) {
     std::cout &lt;&lt; "good" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
   }
 }
};

int main() {
 B b;
 b.a.reset(new A);
 b.a-&gt;b = &amp;b;
}

<p><i>[2014 Urbana]</i></p>

<p>
STL: is this resolved by our change to the reeentrancy rules? [LWG <a href="2414">2414</a>]<br/>
GR: don't think that solves the multi-threaded case<br/>
MC: I like changing the note to normative text<br/>
GR: uses the magic "happens before" words, and "access" is magic too<br/>
JW: I like this. strict improvement, uses the right wording we have to say this properly<br/>
STL: I like the last sentence of the note, could we add that as a new note at the end?<br/>
So add "[Note: This applies even to objects such as mutexes intended for thread synchronization.]" to the end and move to Ready
