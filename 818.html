<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
32.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p1 says in the table that
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Element</th><th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>memory_order_acq_rel</code></td>
<td>the operation has both acquire and release semantics</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
To my naked eye, that seems to imply that even an atomic read has both
acquire and release semantics.
</p>

<p>
Then, p1 says in the table:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Element</th><th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>memory_order_seq_cst</code></td>
<td>the operation has both acquire and release semantics,
    and, in addition, has sequentially-consistent operation ordering</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
So that seems to be "the same thing" as <code>memory_order_acq_rel</code>, with additional
constraints.
</p>

<p>
I'm then reading p2, where it says:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> operations that load a value are acquire operations
on the affected locations. The <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> operations that store a value
are release operations on the affected locations.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
That seems to imply that atomic reads only have acquire semantics.  If that
is intended, does this also apply to <code>memory_order_acq_rel</code> and the individual
load/store operations as well?
</p>

<p>
Also, the table in p1 contains phrases with "thus" that seem to indicate
consequences of normative wording in 6.10.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.multithread">[intro.multithread]</a>.  That shouldn't be in
normative text, for the fear of redundant or inconsistent specification with
the other normative text.
</p>

<p>
Double-check 32.5.8.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.types.operations">[atomics.types.operations]</a> that each
operation clearly says whether it's a load or a store operation, or
both.  (It could be clearer, IMO.  Solution not in current proposed resolution.)
</p>

<p>
32.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p2:  What's a "consistent execution"?  It's not defined in
6.10.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.multithread">[intro.multithread]</a>, it's just used in notes there.
</p>

<p>
And why does 32.5.8.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.types.operations">[atomics.types.operations]</a> p9 for "load" say:
</p>


<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires:</i> The order argument shall not be <code>memory_order_acquire</code>
nor <code>memory_order_acq_rel</code>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
(Since this is exactly the same restriction as for "store", it seems to be a typo.)
</p>

<p>
And then: 32.5.8.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.types.operations">[atomics.types.operations]</a> p12:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
These operations are read-modify-write operations in the sense of the
"synchronizes with" definition (6.10.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.multithread">[intro.multithread]</a>), so both such an operation and the
evaluation that produced the input value synchronize with any evaluation
that reads the updated value.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
This is redundant with 6.10.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.multithread">[intro.multithread]</a>, see above for the reasoning.
</p>

<p>
Boehm: "I don't think that this changes anything terribly substantive,
but it improves the text."
</p>
<p>
Note that "Rephrase the table in as [sic] follows..." should read
"Replace the table in [atomics.order] with the following...."
</p>
<p>
The proposed resolution needs more work. Crowl volunteered to address
all of the atomics issues in one paper.
</p>

<p>
This issue is addressed in
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2783.htm">N2783</a>.

<p id="res-818"><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
edit 32.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a>, paragraph 1 as follows.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The enumeration <code>memory_order</code>
specifies the detailed regular (non-atomic) memory synchronization order
as defined in <del>Clause 1.7</del> <ins>section 1.10</ins>
and may provide for operation ordering.
Its enumerated values and their meanings are as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>

<dt><ins>For <code>memory_order_relaxed</code>,</ins></dt>
<dd><ins>no operation orders memory.</ins></dd>
<dt><ins>For <code>memory_order_release</code>,

and <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code>,</ins></dt>
<dd><ins>a store operation performs a release operation

<p>
remove table 136 in 32.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a>.

<p>
edit 32.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a>, paragraph 2 as follows.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<del>The <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> operations that load a value
are acquire operations on the affected locations.
The <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> operations that store a value
are release operations on the affected locations.
In addition, in a consistent execution,
there</del> <ins>There</ins> <del>must be</del> <ins>is</ins>
a single total order <var>S</var>
on all <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> operations,
consistent with the happens before order
and modification orders for all affected locations,
such that each <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> operation
observes either the last preceding modification
according to this order <var>S</var>,
or the result of an operation that is not <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code>.
[<i>Note:</i>
Although it is not explicitly required that <var>S</var> include locks,
it can always be extended to an order
that does include lock and unlock operations,
since the ordering between those
is already included in the happens before ordering.
