<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>The complexity of binary_search() is stated as "At most
log(last-first) + 2 comparisons", which seems to say that the
algorithm has logarithmic complexity. However, this algorithms is
defined for forward iterators. And for forward iterators, the need to
step element-by-element results into linear complexity. But such a
statement is missing in the standard. The same applies to
lower_bound(), upper_bound(), and equal_range().&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
However, strictly speaking the standard contains no bug here. So this
might considered to be a clarification or improvement.
</p>


<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>The complexity is expressed in terms of comparisons, and that
complexity can be met even if the number of iterators accessed is
linear. Paragraph 1 already says exactly what happens to
iterators.</p>
