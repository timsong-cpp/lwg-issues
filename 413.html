<p>
The second sentence of the proposed resolution says:
</p>

<p>
"If it inserted no characters because it caught an exception thrown
while extracting characters from sb and ..."
</p>

<p>
However, we are not extracting from sb, but extracting from the
basic_istream (*this) and inserting into sb. I can't really tell if
"extracting" or "sb" is a typo.
</p>

<p><i>[
Sydney: Definitely a real issue. We are, indeed, extracting characters
from an istream and not from sb. The problem was there in the FDIS and
wasn't fixed by issue <a href="64">64</a>. Probably what was intended was
to have *this instead of sb. We're talking about the exception flag
state of a basic_istream object, and there's only one basic_istream
object in this discussion, so that would be a consistent
interpretation.  (But we need to be careful: the exception policy of
this member function must be consistent with that of other
extractors.)  PJP will provide wording.

<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>Change the sentence from:</p>

<blockquote><p>
If it inserted no characters because it caught an exception thrown
while extracting characters from sb and failbit is on in exceptions(),
then the caught exception is rethrown.
</p></blockquote>

<p>to:</p>

<blockquote><p>
If it inserted no characters because it caught an exception thrown
while extracting characters from *this and failbit is on in exceptions(),
then the caught exception is rethrown.
</p></blockquote>
