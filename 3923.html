<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The wording of 17.3.5.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/numeric.limits.general">[numeric.limits.general]</a> seemingly has not been gone through a similar thorough 
rewording review which we performed in the past to clean-up the working draft as we did via the series of 
"Mandating" papers by Marshall Clow (<a href="https://wg21.link/P1458">P1458</a> - <a href="https://wg21.link/P1465">P1465</a> and even more).
<p/>
17.3.5.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/numeric.limits.general">[numeric.limits.general]</a> contains several nowadays inappropriate wording forms, which don't 
distinguish well enough between requirements imposed on implementations (Where we shouldn't use "shall" wording 
in the ambiguous form of "Specializations shall be provided for each arithmetic type") and requirements imposed on
user types, this has also caused confusion as expressed in LWG <a href="3922">3922</a>. It is "obvious"
that a program is intended to be allowed to provide program-defined specializations, but as 
LWG <a href="3922">3922</a> points out, it is unclear how such a specialization is able to meet the requirement 
"(b) the specialization meets the standard library requirements for the original template" specified in 
16.4.5.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/namespace.std">[namespace.std]</a> p2.
<p/>
Another problem is the usage of the unclear wording "Non-arithmetic standard types", which should be replaced by
a more precise wording form.
<p/>
An additional problem is that we actually already <em>do</em> require an implementation to provide specializations
for the (library-provided) integer-class types (25.3.4.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.concept.winc">[iterator.concept.winc]</a>), so contrary to what p6
says, we already have at least one exception, where the library is required to specialize <tt>numeric_limits</tt>
for a non-arithmetic type. We should make that a bit clearer here as well.
<p/>
This issue is related to LWG <a href="3922">3922</a> and paper <a href="https://wg21.link/P1841">P1841</a>.

[<i>Drafting Note:</i> It is unclear whether the requirement in the following paragraph 2 is intended to apply to
program-defined specializations as well. Consider as an example a user-defined arithmetic-like type that provides 
arbitrary precision arithmetic which may require dynamic memory for certain object constructions. Is it invalid to specialize 
<tt>numeric_limits</tt> for such a type or may the program-defined specialization deviate from this requirement for 
at least some of its members?
<p/>
If we want to make this restriction relaxed for program-defined specializations, further wording would
be needed to give that permission]

-2- For all members declared <tt>static constexpr</tt> in the <tt>numeric_limits</tt> template, specializations shall 
define these values in such a way that they are usable as constant expressions.

return a value-initialized object.

[<i>Drafting Note:</i> If we had introduced <tt>numeric_limits</tt> today we would likely have only allowed to
provide specializations for <i>cv</i>-unqualified program-defined types, but that ship has sailed long ago.
<p/>
Interestingly currently there doesn't exist a specification that defines under which situations the static member
<tt>is_specialized</tt> should be defined <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt> (This touches LWG <a href="205">205</a>). 
The wording below does not attempt to improve that situation, but at least clarifies that its value may be different
from that of the primary template.
<p/>
Note that this proposed wording does &mdash; opposed to the approach of LWG <a href="3922">3922</a> &mdash; not restrict 
that specializations can only be provided by program-defined types "emulating an arithmetic type", because that would 
break existing specializations and is also problematic in the light of the non-existing definition of that term.
<p/>
The below wording strategy gives permission to specialize <tt>numeric_limits</tt> only for non-array object types.
An alternative approach could make it a precondition instead to instantiate the template for non-array object types, 
for example.]

</blockquote>
<p>
<ins>-?- A program may specialize the <tt>numeric_limits</tt> template for a program-defined non-array object type. 
Such a specialization is permitted to define a value for any static member that differs from what the primary 
template would have defined, as appropriate for that type.</ins>

[<i>Drafting Note:</i> I have left the "shall" usage in p1, because this seems to be a requirement for program-defined
specializations as well. The second sentence of p1 is one of the funny ones which partially look like introductory
wording, but also seems to indicate requirements, albeit specified in an unusual way ("meaningful").
<p/>
The extra wording added after p2 below attempts to improve the wording situation caused by LWG <a href="559">559</a>
and does that by following a similar approach as done in 22.4.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/tuple.helper">[tuple.helper]</a>.
