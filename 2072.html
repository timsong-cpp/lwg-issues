<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
According to 99 [temporary.buffer] p1+2:

</p><blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;
pair&lt;T*, ptrdiff_t&gt; get_temporary_buffer(ptrdiff_t n) noexcept;
</pre><blockquote><p>
-1- <i>Effects</i>: Obtains a pointer to storage sufficient to store up to <tt>n</tt> adjacent <tt>T</tt> 
objects. It is implementation-defined whether over-aligned types are supported (3.11).
<p/>
-2- <i>Returns</i>: A pair containing the buffer's address and capacity (in the units of <tt>sizeof(T)</tt>), 
or a pair of 0 values if no storage can be obtained or if <tt>n &lt;= 0</tt>.
</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
I read this as prohibiting to return a buffer of which capacity is less than <tt>n</tt>, because 
such a buffer is not sufficient to store <tt>n</tt> objects.
<p/>
The corresponding description in <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/get_temporary_buffer.html">SGI STL</a> 
is clear on this point, but I think it is a bit too verbose:
</p>

<blockquote class="note"><p>
(for the return value, a pair <tt>P</tt>) [...] the buffer pointed to by <tt>P.first</tt> is large enough 
to hold <tt>P.second</tt> objects of type <tt>T</tt>. <tt>P.second</tt> is greater than or equal to 0, 
and less than or equal to <tt>len</tt>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
There seems to be two different targets of the "up to n" modification:
The capacity of obtained buffer, and the actual number that the caller
will store into the buffer.
<p/>
First I read as the latter, and got surprised seeing that libstdc++
implementation can return a smaller buffer. I started searching about
<tt>get_temporary_buffer()</tt>. After reading a quote from TC++PL at
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3264299/why-do-i-need-stdget-temporary-buffer">stackoverflow</a>, 
I realized that the former is intended.
<p/>
Such misinterpretation seems common:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The above question is likely started from same misinterpretation.</li>
<li><p>JIS standard (Japanese translation of ISO&#47;IEC standard) says nothing
    like "up to". I think the editor misinterpreted the original wording,
    and omitted words for "up to" as it is redundant. (If a buffer is
    sufficient to store <tt>n</tt> objects, it is also sufficient to store
    up to <tt>n</tt> objects.)</p></li>
<li><p>Rogue Wave implementation doesn't return smaller buffer, instead, it
    can return larger buffer on some circumstances. Apache 
	<a href="http://stdcxx.apache.org/">STDCXX</a> is a derived version of that
    implementation, and <a href="https://stdcxx.apache.org/doc/stdlibref/get-temporary-buffer.html">publicly accessible</a>:
</p>
<blockquote class="note"><p>
Specializations of the <tt>get_temporary_buffer()</tt> function template
attempt to allocate a region of storage sufficiently large to store at
least <tt>n</tt> adjacent objects of type <tt>T</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I know one commercial compiler package based on Rogue Wave implementation, 
and its implementation is essentially same as the above.

</ul>

<p><i>[2014-05-18, Daniel comments and suggests concrete wording]</i></p>


<p>
The provided wording attempts to clarify the discussed capacity freedom, but it also makes it clearer that the returned
memory is just "raw memory", which is currently not really clear. In addition the wording clarifies that the deallocating
<tt>return_temporary_buffer</tt> function does not throw exceptions, which I believe is the intention when the preconditions
of the functions are satisfied. Then, my understanding is that we can provide to <tt>return_temporary_buffer</tt> a
null pointer value if that was the value, <tt>get_temporary_buffer()</tt> had returned. Furthermore, as STL noticed, the current 
wording seemingly allows multiple invocations of <tt>return_temporary_buffer</tt> with the same value returned by 
<tt>get_temporary_buffer</tt>; this should be constrained similar to the wording we have for <tt>operator delete</tt> (unfortunately
we miss such wording for allocators).

<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>This wording is relative to N3936.</p>

<ol><li><p>Change 99 [temporary.buffer] as indicated:</p>

non-negative number <tt><i>N</i></tt> of such objects, where <tt><i>N</i> != n</tt> (including <tt><i>N</i> == 0</tt>). [<i>Note</i>: The 
request is non-binding to allow latitude for implementation-specific optimizations of its memory management. &mdash; <i>end note</i>].</ins>

is a null pointer value and <tt>P.second == 0</tt>; otherwise returns a pair <tt>P</tt> such that <tt>P.first</tt> refers to the
