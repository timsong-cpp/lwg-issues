<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<pre>
    basic_filebuf *basic_filebuf::open(const char *, ios_base::open_mode);
</pre>

<p>should be supplemented with the overload:</p>

<pre>
    basic_filebuf *basic_filebuf::open(const wchar_t *, ios_base::open_mode);
</pre>

<p>
Depending on the operating system, one of these forms is fundamental and
the other requires an implementation-defined mapping to determine the
actual filename.
</p>

<p><i>[Sydney: Yes, we want to allow <tt>wchar_t</tt> filenames.  Bill will
  provide wording.]</i></p>

In Toronto we noted that this is issue 5 from
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2004/n1569.htm">N1569</a>.
]</i></p>

<p>
How does this interact with the newly-defined character types, and how
do we avoid interface explosion considering <tt>std::string</tt> overloads that
were added? Propose another solution that is different than the
suggestion proposed by PJP.
</p>
<p>
Suggestion is to make a member template function for <tt>basic_string</tt> (for
<tt>char</tt>, <tt>wchar_t</tt>, <tt>u16char</tt>, <tt>u32char</tt> instantiations), and then just keep a
<tt>const char*</tt> member.
</p>
<p>
Goal is to do implicit conversion between character string literals to
appropriate <tt>basic_string</tt> type. Not quite sure if this is possible.
</p>
<p>
Implementors are free to add specific overloads for non-char character
types.

<p>
Beman is concerned that making these changes to <tt>basic_filebuf</tt> is not
usefully changed unless <tt>fstream</tt> is also changed; this also only handles
<tt>wchar_t</tt> and not other character types.
</p>
<p>
The TR2 filesystem library is a more complete solution, but is not available soon.

<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>

<p>Change from:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
basic_filebuf&lt;charT,traits>* open(
    const char* s,
    ios_base::openmode mode );
</pre>

<p>
Effects: If is_open() != false, returns a null pointer.
Otherwise, initializes the filebuf as required. It then
opens a file, if possible, whose name is the NTBS s ("as if"
by calling std::fopen(s,modstr)).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>to:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
basic_filebuf&lt;charT,traits>* open(
    const char* s,
    ios_base::openmode mode );

basic_filebuf&lt;charT,traits>* open(
    const wchar_t* ws,
    ios_base::openmode mode );
</pre>

<p>
<i>Effects</i>: If <tt>is_open() != false</tt>, returns a null pointer.
Otherwise, initializes the <tt>filebuf</tt> as required. It then
opens a file, if possible, whose name is the NTBS <tt>s</tt> ("as if"
by calling <tt>std::fopen(s,modstr)</tt>).
For the second signature, the NTBS <tt>s</tt> is determined from the
WCBS <tt>ws</tt> in an implementation-defined manner.
</p>

<p>
(NOTE: For a system that "naturally" represents a filename
as a WCBS, the NTBS s in the first signature may instead
be mapped to a WCBS; if so, it follows the same mapping
rules as the first argument to open.)
</p>
</blockquote>



<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>
Slightly controversial, but by a 7-1 straw poll the LWG agreed to move
this to Ready.  The controversy was because the mapping between wide
names and files in a filesystem is implementation defined.  The
counterargument, which most but not all LWG members accepted, is that
the mapping between narrow files names and files is also
implemenation defined.</p>

<p><i>[Lillehammer: Moved back to "open" status, at Beman's urging.
(1) Why just basic_filebuf, instead of also basic_fstream (and
possibly other things too). (2) Why not also constructors that take
std::basic_string? (3) We might want to wait until we see Beman's
filesystem library; we might decide that it obviates this.]</i></p>


<p><i>[
post Bellevue:
]</i></p>


<blockquote>
<p>
Move again to Ready.
</p>
<p>
There is a timing issue here. Since the filesystem library will not be
in C++0x, this should be brought forward. This solution would remain
valid in the context of the proposed filesystem.
</p>
<p>
This issue has been kicking around for a while, and the wchar_t addition
alone would help many users. Thus, we suggest putting this on the
reflector list with an invitation for someone to produce proposed
wording that covers basic_fstream. In the meantime, we suggest that the
proposed wording be adopted as-is.
</p>
<p>
If more of the Lillehammer questions come back, they should be
introduced as separate issues.
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Some existing implementations provide overload already. Expected
filesystem "path" object overloads neatly, without surprises; implying
NAD.
