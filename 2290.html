<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The current library specification uses at several places wording that is intended to refer to
core language template deduction failure at the top-level of expressions (aka "SFINAE"), for example:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The expression <tt>declval&lt;T&gt;() = declval&lt;U&gt;()</tt> is well-formed when treated as an unevaluated operand (Clause 5). 
Access checking is performed as if in a context unrelated to <tt>T</tt> and <tt>U</tt>. Only the validity of the immediate context 
of the assignment expression is considered. [<i>Note:</i> The compilation of the expression can result in side effects 
such as the instantiation of class template specializations and function template specializations, the generation of
implicitly-defined functions, and so on. Such side effects are not in the "immediate context" and can result in the program
being ill-formed. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Similar wording can be found in the specification of <tt>result_of</tt>, <tt>is_constructible</tt>, and <tt>is_convertible</tt>,
being added to resolve an NB comment by LWG <a href="1390">1390</a> and <a href="1391">1391</a> through 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3142.html">N3142</a>.
<p/>
This wording is necessary to limit speculative compilations needed to implement these traits, but it is also lengthy and repetitive.
</p>

<p><i>[2014-05-19, Daniel suggests a descriptive term]</i></p>

<p>
<b>constrictedly well-formed expression</b>:
<p/>
An expression <em>e</em> depending on a set of types <tt>A1</tt>, ..., <tt>An</tt> which is well-formed when treated as 
an unevaluated operand (Clause 5). Access checking is performed as if in a context unrelated to <tt>A1</tt>, ..., 
<tt>An</tt>. Only the validity of the immediate context of <em>e</em> is considered. [<i>Note:</i> The compilation of 
the expression can result in side effects such as the instantiation of class template specializations and function 
template specializations, the generation of implicitly-defined functions, and so on. Such side effects are not in the 
"immediate context" and can result in the program being ill-formed. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p>

<p><i>[2014-05-20, Richard and Jonathan suggest better terms]</i></p>

<p>
Richard suggested "locally well-formed"
<p/>
Jonathan suggested "contextually well-formed" and then "The expression ... is valid in a contrived argument
deduction context"
</p>

<p><i>[2014-06-07, Daniel comments and improves wording]</i></p>

<p>
The 2014-05-19 suggestion did only apply to expressions, but there are two important examples that are not expressions, but instead
are involving an <em>object definition</em> (<tt>std::is_constructible</tt>) and a <em>function definition</em> 
(<tt>std::is_convertible</tt>), respectively, instead. Therefore I suggest to rephrase the usage of "expression" into "program 
construct" in the definition of Jonathan's suggestion of "valid in a contrived argument deduction context".
<p/>
I would like to point out that given the new definition of "valid in a contrived argument deduction context", there are several other 
places of the Library specification that could take advantage of this wording to improve the existing specification, such as 
20.14.12.2 [func.wrap.func] p2, most functions in 20.10.8.2 [allocator.traits.members], and the <tt>**Insertable</tt>, 
<tt>EmplaceConstructible</tt>, and <tt>Erasable</tt> definitions in 23.2.1 [container.requirements.general], but given that
these are not fully described in terms of the aforementioned wording <em>yet</em>, I would recommend to fix them by a separate issue 
once the committee has agreed on following the suggestion presented by this issue.
</p>

<p><i>[2015-05-05 Lenexa: Move to Open]</i></p>

<p>...</p>
<p>MC: I think we like the direction but it isn't quite right: it needs some work</p>
<p>JW: I'm prepared to volunteer to move that further, hopefully with the help of Daniel</p>
<p>Roger Orr: should this be Core wording because it doesn't really have anything to do with libraries - the term could then just be used here</p>
<p>AM: Core has nothing to deal with that, though</p>
<p>HT: it seems there is nothing to imply that allows dropping out with an error - maybe that's a separate issue</p>
<p>MC: I'm not getting what you are getting at: could you write an issue? - any objection to move to Open?</p>
<p>...</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>This wording is relative to N3936.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add the following new definition to 17.3 [definitions] as indicated:</p>

<p>
<ins><b>valid in a contrived argument deduction context</b> [defns.valid.contr.context]</ins>
<p/>
<ins>A program construct <em>c</em> depending on a set of types <tt>A1</tt>, ..., <tt>An</tt>, and treated as 
an unevaluated operand (Clause 5) when <em>c</em> is an expression, which is well-formed. 
Access checking is performed as if in a context unrelated to <tt>A1</tt>, ..., <tt>An</tt>. 
Only the validity of the immediate context (14.8.2 [temp.deduct]) of <em>c</em> is considered. 
[<i>Note:</i> The compilation of <em>c</em> can result in side effects such as the instantiation of class template 
specializations and function template specializations, the generation of implicitly-defined functions, and so on. 
Such side effects are not in the "immediate context" and can result in the program being ill-formed. &mdash;
