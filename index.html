<html><head><title>Tim's LWG issue list clone </title></head>
<body>Like LWG's official repository, with a few changes:
<ul>
  <li><s>Pages for individual issues, like <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/lwg-issues/1234">https://timsong-cpp.github.io/lwg-issues/1234</a>.</s> This has been merged upstream.</li>
  <li>Inter-issue links go to the individual issue pages rather than the master list.</li>
  <li><s>Section references to a stable name present in the current working draft are automatically linked to my HTML version.</s>Upstream now linkifies those tags too.</li>
  <li>Section reference links go to my HTML version, rather than wg21.link (which in turn goes to eel.is).</li>
  <li>Issue timestamp reflects the timestamp of the last git commit that touched the issue, making it slightly less useless.</li>
  <li>List timestamp is based on the most recent issue timestamp, rather than the time at which the generation script is run.</li>
</ul>

<p>Only updated when I run the script to generate them, though.</p>

<p>The master lists:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="lwg-active.html">Active issues</a></li>
<li><a href="lwg-defects.html">Defect reports</a></li>
<li><a href="lwg-closed.html">Closed issues</a></li>
</ul>
