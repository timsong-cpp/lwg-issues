<p>
The terms <em>valid</em> iterator and <em>singular</em> aren't
properly defined. The fuzziness of those terms became even worse
after the resolution of <a href="lwg-defects.html#208">208</a> (including further updates by <a href="lwg-defects.html#278">278</a>). In
24.2 [iterator.requirements] as of
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2723.pdf">N2723</a>
the standard says now:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
5 - These values are called past-the-end values. Values of an iterator <tt>i</tt> for
which the expression <tt>*i</tt> is defined are called dereferenceable. The library
never assumes that past-the-end values are dereferenceable. Iterators
can also have singular values that are not associated with any
container. [...] Results of most expressions are undefined for singular
values; the only exceptions are destroying an iterator that holds a
singular value and the assignment of a non-singular value to an iterator
that holds a singular value. [...] Dereferenceable values are always
non-singular.
</p>

<p>
10 - An invalid iterator is an iterator that may be singular.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
First, issue <a href="lwg-defects.html#208">208</a> intentionally removed the earlier constraint that past-the-end
values are always non-singular. The reason for this was to support null
pointers as past-the-end iterators of e.g. empty sequences. But there
seem to exist different views on what a singular (iterator) value is. E.g.
according to the <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/trivial.html">SGI definition</a>
a null pointer is <em>not</em> a singular value:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Dereferenceable iterators are always nonsingular, but the converse is
not true.
For example, a null pointer is nonsingular (there are well defined operations
involving null pointers) even thought it is not dereferenceable.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
and <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/InputIterator.html">proceeds</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
An iterator is valid if it is dereferenceable or past-the-end.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Even if the standard prefers a different meaning of singular here, the
change was incomplete, because by restricting feasible expressions of singular
iterators to destruction and assignment isn't sufficient for a past-the-end
iterator: Of-course it must still be equality-comparable and in general be a readable value.
</p>

<p>
Second, the standard doesn't clearly say whether a past-the-end value is
a valid iterator or not. E.g. 20.10.10 [specialized.algorithms]/1 says:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
In all of the following algorithms, the formal template parameter <tt>ForwardIterator</tt> 
is required to satisfy the requirements of a forward iterator (24.1.3)
[..], and is required to have the property that no exceptions are thrown from [..], or
dereference of valid iterators.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The standard should make better clear what "singular pointer" and "valid
iterator" means. The fact that the meaning of a valid <em>value</em>
has a core language meaning doesn't imply that for an iterator concept
the term "valid iterator" has the same meaning.
</p>

<p>
Let me add a final example: In 99 [allocator.concepts.members] of
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2914.pdf">N2914</a>
we find:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
pointer X::allocate(size_type n);
</pre>

<blockquote><p>
11 <i>Returns:</i> a pointer to the allocated memory. [<i>Note:</i> if <tt>n == 0</tt>, the return
value is unspecified. &mdash;<i>end note</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
[..]
</p>

<pre>
void X::deallocate(pointer p, size_type n);
</pre>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Preconditions:</i> <tt>p</tt> shall be a non-singular pointer value obtained from a call
to <tt>allocate()</tt> on this allocator or one that compares equal to it.
</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
If singular pointer value would include null pointers this make the
preconditions
unclear if the pointer value is a result of <tt>allocate(0)</tt>: Since the return value
is unspecified, it could be a null pointer. Does that mean that programmers
need to check the pointer value for a null value before calling deallocate?
