allow multiple concurrent locales to be used in the same application
by introducing a type <tt>locale_t</tt> that is very similar to
<tt>std::locale</tt>, and a number of <tt>_l</tt> functions that make use of it.
</p>
<p>
The global locale (set by setlocale) is now specified to be per-
process. If a thread does not call <tt>uselocale</tt>, the global locale is
in effect for that thread. It can install a per-thread locale by
using <tt>uselocale</tt>.
</p>
<p>
There is also a nice <tt>querylocale</tt> mechanism by which one can obtain
the name (such as "de_DE") for a specific <tt>facet</tt>, even for combined
locales, with no <tt>std::locale</tt> equivalent.
</p>
<p>
<tt>std::locale</tt> should be harmonized with the new POSIX <tt>locale_t</tt>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Each of the three clocks specified in Clocks 25.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.clock">[time.clock]</a>
provides the member function:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
static time_point now();
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The semantics specified by Clock requirements 25.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.clock.req">[time.clock.req]</a>
make no mention of error handling. Thus the function may throw <tt>bad_alloc</tt>
or an implementation-defined exception (15.5.5.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/res.on.exception.handling">[res.on.exception.handling]</a>
paragraph 4).
</p>

<p>
Some implementations of these functions on POSIX, Windows, and
presumably on other operating systems, may fail in ways only detectable
at runtime. Some failures on Windows are due to supporting chipset
errata and can even occur after successful calls to a clock's <tt>now()</tt>
function.
</p>

<p>
These functions are used in cases where exceptions are not appropriate
or where the specifics of the exception or cause of error need to be
available to the user. See
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2828.html">N2828</a>,
<i>Library Support for hybrid error
handling (Rev 1)</i>, for more specific discussion of use cases. Thus some change in
the interface of now is required.
</p>

<p>
The proposed resolution has been implemented in the Boost version of the
chrono library. No problems were encountered.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Both add and multiply could sensibly be called with more than two arguments.
The variadic template facility makes such declarations simple, and is likely
to be frequently wrapped by end users if we do not supply the variant
ourselves.
</p>
<p>
We deliberately ignore divide at this point as it is not transitive.
Likewise, subtract places special meaning on the first argument so I do not
suggest extending that immediately.  Both could be supported with analogous
wording to that for add/multiply below.
</p>
<p>
Note that the proposed resolution is potentially incompatible with that
proposed for <a href="921">921</a>, although the addition of the typedef to ratio would be
equally useful.
</p>

<p><i>[
2009-10-30 Alisdair adds:
]</i></p>


<blockquote>
<p>
The consensus of the group when we reviewed this in Santa Cruz was that
<a href="921">921</a> would proceed to Ready as planned, and the
multi-paramater add/multiply templates should be renamed as
<tt>ratio_sum</tt> and <tt>ratio_product</tt> to avoid the problem
mixing template aliases with partial specializations.
</p>

<p>
It was also suggested to close this issue as NAD Future as it does not
correspond directly to any NB comment.  NBs are free to submit a
specific comment (and re-open) in CD2 though.
</p>

<p>
Walter Brown also had concerns on better directing the order of
evaluation to avoid overflows if we do proceed for 0x rather than TR1,
so wording may not be complete yet.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Unordered associative containers have a notion of a maximum load factor:
when the number of elements grows large enough, the containers
automatically perform a rehash so that the number of elements per bucket
stays below a user-specified bound. This ensures that the hash table's
performance characteristics don't change dramatically as the size
increases.
</p>

<p>
For similar reasons, Google has found it useful to specify a minimum
load factor: when the number of elements shrinks by a large enough, the
containers automatically perform a rehash so that the number of elements
per bucket stays above a user-specified bound. This is useful for two
reasons. First, it prevents wasting a lot of memory when an unordered
associative container grows temporarily. Second, it prevents amortized
iteration time from being arbitrarily large; consider the case of a hash
table with a billion buckets and only one element. (This was discussed
even before TR1 was published; it was TR issue 6.13, which the LWG
closed as NAD on the grounds that it was a known design feature.
However, the LWG did not consider the approach of a minimum load
factor.)
</p>

<p>
The only interesting question is when shrinking is allowed. In principle
the cleanest solution would be shrinking on erase, just as we grow on
insert. However, that would be a usability problem; it would break a
number of common idioms involving erase. Instead, Google's hash tables
only shrink on insert and rehash.
</p>

<p>
The proposed resolution allows, but does not require, shrinking in
rehash, mostly because a postcondition for rehash that involves the
minimum load factor would be fairly complicated. (It would probably have
to involve a number of special cases and it would probably have to
mention yet another parameter, a minimum bucket count.)
</p>

<p>
The current behavior is equivalent to a minimum load factor of 0. If we
specify that 0 is the default, this change will have no impact on
backward compatibility.
</p>

This seems to a useful extension, but is too late for 0x.

<p><i>[LEWG Kona 2017]</i></p>

<p>Should there be a shrink_to_fit()? Is it too surprising to shrink on insert()? (We understand that shrinking on erase() is not an option.) Maybe make people call rehash(0) to shrink to the min_load_factor? On clear(), the load factor goes to 0 or undefined (0/0), which is likely to violate min_load_factor() min_load_factor(z)'s wording should match max_load_factor(z)'s, e.g. "May change the container’s maximum load factor" Want a paper exploring whether shrink-on-insert has been surprising. From Titus: Google's experience is that maps don't shrink in the way this would help with. NAD, not worth the time. Write a paper if you can demonstrate a need for this.</p>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Concerning mathematically proper operation of the type:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
complex&lt;complex&lt;T&gt; &gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Generally accepted mathematical semantics of such a construct correspond
to quaternions through Cayly-Dickson construct
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
(w+xi) + (y+zi) j
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The proper implementation seems straightforward by adding a few
declarations like those below. I have included operator definition for
combining real scalars and complex types, as well, which seems
appropriate, as algebra of complex numbers allows mixing complex and
real numbers with operators. It also allows for constructs such as
<tt>complex&lt;double&gt; i=(0,1),  x = 12.34 + 5*i;</tt>
</p>

<p>
Quaternions are often used in areas such as computer graphics, where,
for example, they avoid the problem of Gimbal lock when rotating objects
in 3D space, and can be more efficient than matrix multiplications,
although I am applying them to a different field.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
There exist optimized, vectorized vendor libraries for the creation of
random number generators, such as Intel's MKL [1] and AMD's ACML [2]. In
timing tests we have seen a performance gain of a factor of up to 80
(eighty) compared to a pure C++ implementation (in Boost.Random) when
using these generator to generate a sequence of normally distributed
random numbers. In codes dominated by the generation of random numbers
(we have application codes where random number generation is more than
50% of the CPU time) this factor 80 is very significant.
</p>

<p>
To make use of these vectorized generators, we use a C++ class modeling
the <tt>RandomNumberEngine</tt> concept and forwarding the generation of random
numbers to those optimized generators. For example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
namespace mkl {
 class mt19937 {.... };
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
For the generation of random variates we also want to dispatch to
optimized vectorized functions in the MKL or ACML libraries. See this
example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
mkl::mt19937 eng;
std::normal_distribution&lt;double&gt; dist;

double n = dist(eng);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Since the variate generation is done through the <tt>operator()</tt> of the
distribution there is no customization point to dispatch to Intel's or
AMD's optimized functions to generate normally distributed numbers based
on the <tt>mt19937</tt> generator. Hence, the performance gain of 80 cannot be
achieved.
</p>

<p>
Contrast this with TR1:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
mkl::mt19937 eng;
std::tr1::normal_distribution&lt;double&gt; dist;
std::tr1::variate_generator&lt;mkl::mt19937,std::tr1::normal_distribution&lt;double&gt; &gt; rng(eng,dist);
double n = rng();
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This - admittedly much uglier from an aestethic point of view - design
allowed optimization by specializing the <tt>variate_generator</tt> template for
<tt>mkl::mt19937</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
namespace std { namespace tr1 {

template&lt;&gt;
class variate_generator&lt;mkl::mt19937,std::tr1::normal_distribution&lt;double&gt; &gt; { .... };

} }
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
A similar customization point is missing in the C++0x design and
prevents the optimized vectorized version to be used.
</p>

<p>
Suggested resolution:
</p>

<p>
Add a customization point to the distribution concept. Instead of the
<tt>variate_generator</tt> template this can be done through a call to a
free function <tt>generate_variate</tt> found by ADL instead of
<tt>operator()</tt> of the distribution:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;RandomNumberDistribution, class RandomNumberEngine&gt;
typename RandomNumberDistribution ::result_type
generate_variate(RandomNumberDistribution const&amp; dist, RandomNumberEngine&amp; eng);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This function can be overloaded for optimized enginges like
<tt>mkl::mt19937</tt>.

<li>
<p>
Motivation and Scope
</p>
<p>
Splitting strings into parts by some set of delimiters is an often task, but
there is no simple and generalized solution in C++ Standard. Usually C++
developers use <tt>std::basic_stringstream&lt;&gt;</tt> to split string into
parts, but there are several inconvenient restrictions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
we cannot explicitly assign the set of delimiters;
</li>
<li>
this approach is suitable only for strings, but not for other types of
containers;
</li>
<li>
we have (possible) performance leak due to string instantiation.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Impact on the Standard
</p>
<p>
This algorithm doesn't interfere with any of current standard algorithms.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Design Decisions
</p>
<p>
This algorithm is implemented in terms of input/output iterators. Also, there is
one additional wrapper for <tt>const CharType *</tt> specified delimiters.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Example implementation
</p>
<pre>
template&lt; class It, class DelimIt, class OutIt &gt;
void split( It begin, It end, DelimIt d_begin, DelimIt d_end, OutIt out )
{
   while ( begin != end )
   {
       It it = std::find_first_of( begin, end, d_begin, d_end );
       *out++ = std::make_pair( begin, it );
       begin = std::find_first_of( it, end, d_begin, d_end,
           std::not2( std::equal_to&lt; typename It::value_type &gt;() ) );
   }
}

template&lt; class It, class CharType, class OutIt &gt;
void split( It begin, It end, const CharType * delim, OutIt out )
{
   split( begin, end, delim, delim + std::strlen( delim ), out );
}

<li>
<p>
Usage
</p>
<pre>
std::string ss( "word1 word2 word3" );
std::vector&lt; std::pair&lt; std::string::const_iterator, std::string::const_iterator &gt; &gt; v;
split( ss.begin(), ss.end(), " ", std::back_inserter( v ) );

for ( int i = 0; i &lt; v.size(); ++i )
{
   std::cout &lt;&lt; std::string( v[ i ].first, v[ i ].second ) &lt;&lt; std::endl;

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In section 15.5.3.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/allocator.requirements">[allocator.requirements]</a>, Table 40 &mdash; Allocator requirements,
the following expression is required for allocator pointers:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1">
<caption>Table 40 &mdash; Allocator requirements</caption>
<tr>
<th>Expression</th>
<th>Return type</th>
<th>Assertion/note<br/>pre-/post-condition</th>
<th>Default</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>static_cast&lt;X::pointer&gt;(w)</tt></td>
<td><tt>X::pointer</tt></td>
<td><tt>static_cast&lt;X::pointer&gt;(w) == p</tt></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
To achieve this expression, a smart pointer writer must introduce an explicit
conversion operator from <tt>smart_ptr&lt;void&gt;</tt> to
<tt>smart_ptr&lt;T&gt;</tt> so that
<tt>static_cast&lt;pointer&gt;(void_ptr)</tt> is a valid expression.
Unfortunately this explicit conversion weakens the safety of a smart pointer
since the following expression (invalid for raw pointers) would become valid:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
smart_ptr&lt;void&gt; smart_v = ...;
smart_ptr&lt;T&gt; smart_t(smart_v);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
On the other hand, <tt>shared_ptr</tt> also defines its own casting functions in
19.11.3.9 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared.cast">[util.smartptr.shared.cast]</a>, and although it's unlikely that a
programmer will use <tt>shared_ptr</tt> as <tt>allocator::pointer</tt>, having
two different ways to do the same cast operation does not seem reasonable. A
possible solution would be to replace <tt>static_cast&lt;X::pointer&gt;(w)</tt>
expression with a user customizable (via ADL)
<tt>static_pointer_cast&lt;value_type&gt;(w)</tt>, and establish the
<tt>xxx_pointer_cast</tt> functions introduced by <tt>shared_ptr</tt> as the
recommended generic casting utilities of the standard.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, we've experienced problems in Boost when trying to establish
<tt>xxx_pointer_cast</tt> as customization points for generic libraries (<a
href="http://objectmix.com/c/40424-adl-lookup-explicit-template-parameters.html"
>http://objectmix.com/c/40424-adl-lookup-explicit-template-parameters.html</a>)
because these casting functions are called with explicit template parameters and
the standard says in 12.9.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/temp.arg.explicit">[temp.arg.explicit]</a> p.8 "Explicit template
argument specification":
</p>

<blockquote><p>
8 ...But when a function template with explicit template arguments is used, the
call does not have the correct syntactic form unless there is a function
template with that name visible at the point of the call. If no such name is
visible, the call is not syntactically well-formed and argument-dependent lookup
does not apply.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
So we can do this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class BasePtr&gt;
void generic_ptr_swap(BasePtr p)
{
  //ADL customization point
  swap(p, p);
  //...
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
but not the following:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class BasePtr&gt;
void generic_ptr_algo(BasePtr p)
{
  typedef std::pointer_traits&lt;BasePtr&gt;::template
     rebind&lt;Derived&gt; DerivedPtr;
  DerivedPtr dp = static_pointer_cast&lt;Derived&gt;(p);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The solution to make <tt>static_pointer_cast</tt> a customization point is to
add a generic declaration (no definition) of <tt>static_pointer_cast</tt> in a
namespace (like <tt>std</tt>) and apply "<tt>using
std::static_pointer_cast</tt>" declaration to activate ADL:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
namespace std{

template&lt;typename U, typename T&gt;
<i>unspecified</i>
static_pointer_cast(T&amp;&amp;) = delete;

}

template&lt;class BasePtr&gt;
void generic_ptr_algo(BasePtr p)
{
  typedef std::pointer_traits&lt;BasePtr&gt;::template
     rebind&lt;Derived&gt; DerivedPtr;

  //ADL applies because static_pointer_cast is made
  //  visible according to [temp.arg.explicit]/8
  using std::static_pointer_cast;

  DerivedPtr dp = static_pointer_cast&lt;Derived&gt;(p);

  //...
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
A complete solution will need also the definition of
<tt>static_pointer_cast</tt> for raw pointers, and this definition has been
present in Boost (<a
href="http://www.boost.org/boost/pointer_cast.hpp">http://www.boost.org/boost/
pointer_cast.hpp</a>) for years.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Currently, the library lacks a convenient way to provide a hash function that
can be used with the provided unordered containers to allow the usage of non
trivial element types.
</p>

<p>
While we can easily declare an
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
std::unordered_set&lt;int&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
or
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
std::unordered_set&lt;std::string&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
we have no easy way to declare an <tt>unordered_set</tt> for a user defined
type. IMO, this is a big obstacle to use unordered containers in practice. Note
that in Java, the wide usage of <tt>HashMap</tt> is based on the fact that there
is always a default hash function provided.
</p>

<p>
Of course, a default hash function implies the risk to provide poor hash
functions. But often even poor hash functions are good enough.
</p>

<p>
While I really would like to see a default hash function, I don't propose it
here because this would probably introduce a discussion that's too big for this
state of C++0x.
</p>

<p>
However, I strongly suggest at least to provide a convenience variadic template
function <tt>make_hash&lt;&gt;()</tt> to allow an easy definition of a (possibly
poor) hash function.
</p>

<p>
As a consequence for a user-defined type such as
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
class Customer {
   friend class CustomerHash;
   private:
     string firstname;
     string lastname;
     long   no;
   ...
 };
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
would allow to specify:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
class CustomerHash : public std::unary_function&lt;Customer, std::size_t&gt;
{
  public:
    std::size_t operator() (const Customer&amp; c) const  {
       return make_hash(c.firstname,c.lastname,c.no);
    }
};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
instead of:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
class CustomerHash : public std::unary_function&lt;Customer, std::size_t&gt;
{
  public:
    std::size_t operator() (const Customer&amp; c) const  {
       return std::hash&lt;std::string&gt;()(c.firstname) +
              std::hash&lt;std::string&gt;()(c.lastname) +
              std::hash&lt;long&gt;()(c.no);
    }
};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Note that, in principle, we can either specify that
</p>

<blockquote><p>
<tt>make_hash</tt> returns the sum of a call of
<tt>std::hash&lt;T&gt;()(x)</tt> for each argument <tt>x</tt> of type
<tt>T</tt>
</p></blockquote>

<p>
or we can specify that
</p>

<blockquote><p>
<tt>make_hash</tt> provides a hash value for each argument, for which a
<tt>std::hash()</tt> function is provided
</p></blockquote>

<p>
with the possible note that the hash value may be poor or only a good hash value
if the ranges of all passed arguments is equally distributed.
</p>

<p>
For my convenience, I propose wording that describes
the concrete implementation.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p><b>Addresses JP-5</b></p>
<p>
Hash support based on ownership sharing should be
supplied for <tt>shared_ptr</tt> and <tt>weak_ptr</tt>.
For two <tt>shared_ptr</tt> objects <tt>p</tt> and <tt>q</tt>, two distinct
equivalence relations can be defined. One is based on
equivalence of pointer values, which is derived from the
expression <tt>p.get() == q.get()</tt> (hereafter called <i>address based
equivalence relation</i>), the other is based on
equivalence of ownership sharing, which is derived from
the expression <tt>!p.owner_before(q) &amp;&amp; !q.owner_before(p)</tt>
(hereafter called <i>ownership-based equivalence relation</i>).
These two equivalence relations are independent in
general. For example, a <tt>shared_ptr</tt> object created by the
constructor of the signature <tt>shared_ptr(shared_ptr&lt;U>
const &amp;, T *)</tt> could reveal a difference between these two
relations. Therefore, hash support based on each
equivalence relation should be supplied for <tt>shared_ptr</tt>.
However, while the standard library provides the hash
support for address-based one (20.9.11.6 paragraph 2), it
lacks the hash support for ownership-based one. In
addition, associative containers work well in combination
with the <tt>shared_ptr</tt>'s ownership-based comparison but
unordered associative containers don't. This is
inconsistent.
</p>
<p>
For the case of <tt>weak_ptr</tt>, hash support for the ownership based
equivalence relation can be safely defined on
<tt>weak_ptr</tt>s, and even on expired ones. The absence of
hash support for the ownership-based equivalence
relation is fatal, especially for expired <tt>weak_ptr</tt>s. And the
absence of such hash support precludes some quite
effective use-cases, e.g. erasing the <tt>unordered_map</tt> entry
of an expired <tt>weak_ptr</tt> key from a customized deleter
supplied to <tt>shared_ptr</tt>s.
</p>
<p>
Hash support for the ownership-based equivalence
relation cannot be provided by any user-defined manner
because information about ownership sharing is not
available to users at all. Therefore, the only way to provide
ownership-based hash support is to offer it intrusively by
the standard library.
</p>
<p>
As far as we know, such hash support is implementable.
Typical implementation of such hash function could return
the hash value of the pointer of the counter object that is
internally managed by <tt>shared_ptr</tt> and <tt>weak_ptr</tt>.

These functions satisfy the following

as if it were equivalent to the expression <tt>h(p)</tt>. In
addition, <tt>h(p) == h(q)</tt> must become <tt>true</tt> if <tt>p</tt> and
<tt>q</tt> share ownership.

<p>
The <tt>wstring_convert</tt> class template, described in D.14.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/depr.conversions.string">[depr.conversions.string]</a>, does not 
support custom stateful allocators. It only supports custom stateless allocators.
<p/>
The <tt>to_bytes</tt> member function returns <tt>basic_string&lt;char, char_traits&lt;char&gt;, Byte_alloc&gt;</tt>  
but it does not take an instance of <tt>Byte_alloc</tt> to pass to the constructor of the <tt>basic_string</tt>.
<p/>
Similarly the <tt>from_bytes</tt> member function returns <tt>basic_string&lt;Elem, char_traits&lt;Elem&gt;, Wide_alloc&gt;</tt>  
but it does not take an instance of <tt>Wide_alloc</tt> to pass to the constructor of the <tt>basic_string</tt>.
<p/>
This makes these two member functions and the <tt>wstring_convert</tt> class template not usable when <tt>Wide_alloc</tt> 
or <tt>Byte_alloc</tt> are stateful allocators.

<p>
Currently, <tt>std::experimental::optional::operator==</tt> imposes the <tt>EqualityComparable</tt> requirement which provides
two guarantees: It ensures that <tt>operator!=</tt> can rely on the equivalence-relation property and more importantly, that
the <tt>BooleanTestable</tt> requirements suggested by issue <a href="2114">2114</a> are automatically implied.
<p/>
<tt>std::experimental::optional::operator&lt;</tt> doesn't provide a <tt>LessThanComparable</tt> requirement, but there was quite
an historic set of changes involved with that family of types: As of <a href="http://wg21.link/n3527.html">N3527</a>
this operator was defined in terms of <tt>operator&lt;</tt> of the contained type <tt>T</tt> and imposed the <tt>LessThanComparable</tt> 
requirement. In the final acceptance step of <tt>optional</tt> by the committee, the definition was expressed in terms of <tt>std::less</tt>
and the <tt>LessThanComparable</tt> requirement had been removed.
<p/>
The inconsistency between <tt>operator==</tt> and <tt>operator&lt;</tt> should be removed. One possible course of action would be 
to add the <tt>LessThanComparable</tt> to <tt>std::experimental::optional::operator&lt;</tt>. The <tt>EqualityComparable</tt> requirement
of <tt>operator==</tt> could also be removed, but in that case both operators would at least need to require the <tt>BooleanTestable</tt> 
requirements (see <a href="2114">2114</a>) for the result type of <tt>T</tt>'s <tt>operator==</tt> and <tt>operator&lt;</tt>. 
<p/>
Arguably, corresponding operators for <tt>pair</tt> and <tt>tuple</tt> do not impose <tt>LessThanComparable</tt> (nor
<tt>EqualityComparable</tt>), albeit the definition of the "derived" relation functions depend on properties ensured by
<tt>LessThanComparable</tt>. According to the <a href="https://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/pair.html">SGI definition</a>, the intention was
to imposed both <tt>EqualityComparable</tt> and <tt>LessThanComparable</tt>. If this is not intended, the standard should clarify
this position.

<p>
DR <a href="41">41</a>, "Ios_base needs <tt>clear()</tt>, <tt>exceptions()</tt>" stopped short of providing the interface 
suggested in its title, but it did require the underlying state to be stored in <tt>ios_base</tt>. Because <tt>rdstate()</tt> 
is also missing, <tt>ios_base</tt> manipulators relying on <tt>iword</tt> and <tt>pword</tt> cannot detect failure. 
The only safe alternative is to manipulate a derived class, which must be a template.
<p/>
libc++ already provides the interface as a nonconforming extension. libstdc++ implements the internal state but leaves 
it frustratingly inaccessible, as specified. Any conforming implementation should be able to provide the interface 
without ABI problems.

This is really a request for an (feature) API. Passing to LEWG.

<p>Recommend NAD: iostreams aren't used in this way enough to spend committee time on it. However, a paper could change our minds.</p>

The current specification of <tt>basic_osyncstream::rdbuf()</tt> is
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
    syncbuf_type* rdbuf() const noexcept { return &amp;sb; }
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is ill-formed because the exposition-only member <tt>sb</tt> is <tt>const</tt> inside this <tt>const</tt> member function,
but the return type is a pointer to non-<tt>const</tt> <tt>syncbuf_type</tt>. It needs to cast away the constness, consistent
with the other streams with embedded stream buffers (such as string and file streams).

The specification of <tt>regex_token_iterator</tt> for the overload taking a 
<tt>const int (&amp;submatchs)[N]</tt> uses the range <tt>[&amp;submatches, &amp;submatches + N)</tt>.
This is obviously incorrect; we want to perform pointer arithmetic on a pointer to the first element

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
<tt>expects</tt> and <tt>ensures</tt> are not technically described as <i>attribute-tokens</i> when used 
in a <i>contract-attribute-specifier</i>, so the existing prohibition in 15.5.4.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/macro.names">[macro.names]</a>
doesn't apply to them.
<p/>
The remaining special identifiers used by the contract attributes are all already covered by existing wording:
<tt>assert</tt> is also a library name so falls under p1, <tt>default</tt> is a keyword, and both <tt>axiom</tt>
and <tt>audit</tt> were added to Table 4.

<p>
The LFTSv3 prospective-working-paper <a href="http://wg21.link/n4758">N4758</a> lists a large number of type trait 
variable templates in [meta.type.synop] that are duplicates of corresponding ones in C++17. The paper 
<a href="http://wg21.link/P0996R1">P0996R1</a> that was meant to rebase the LFTS on C++17 appears to have missed them.

<p>
After acceptance of <a href="http://wg21.link/P0941R2">P0941R2</a> into the working draft, in [support.limits.general], 
<tt>__cpp_lib_to_chars</tt> is required to be in <tt>&lt;utility&gt;</tt>. Since the relevant feature 
(<tt>std::to_chars</tt> and <tt>std::from_chars</tt>) is now in the header <tt>&lt;charconv&gt;</tt>, 
should the macro be defined in <tt>&lt;charconv&gt;</tt> instead of <tt>&lt;utility&gt;</tt>?
</p>
<p><i>[Marshall provides P/R and context]</i></p>

<p><tt>std::to_chars</tt>, etc were originally proposed for the header <tt>&lt;utility&gt;</tt>
and SD-6 reflected that. Somewhere along the way, they was put into their own header 
<tt>&lt;charconv&gt;</tt>, but the document was never updated to reflect that.</p>
<p>When these macros were added to the standard, the (now incorrect) value was copied as well.</p>

<p>
15.5.4.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/macro.names">[macro.names]</a>/2 forbids a translation unit to define names "lexically identical to [&hellip;] the 
<i>attribute-token</i>s described in 9.11 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/dcl.attr">[dcl.attr]</a>." We recently added the attribute-tokens <tt>likely</tt> 
and <tt>unlikely</tt> (9.11.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/dcl.attr.likelihood">[dcl.attr.likelihood]</a>). These names are in extremely wide use as function-like 
macros in the open source community, forbidding users to define them breaks large amounts of code. (Reportedly 
Chromium contains 19 definitions each of "likely" and "unlikely" as function-like macros.)
<p/>
Indeed, this issue came up during EWG discussion of <a href="http://wg21.link/p0479R1">P0479R1</a> "Attributes 
for Likely and Unlikely Statements" in Kona, and EWG decided to keep the names "likely" and "unlikely" for the attribute 
tokens since the usage wouldn't conflict with defining them as function-like macros. 15.5.4.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/macro.names">[macro.names]</a>/2 should 
not break large amounts of existing code that doesn't actually conflict with the use of the <tt>[[likely]]</tt> and 
<tt>[[unlikely]]</tt> attributes.
