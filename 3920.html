<p>
16.4.5.3.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/extern.names">[extern.names]</a> p1 and p2 reserve certain names with external linkage to the implementation.
<p/>
Each paragraph has a footnote, stating that such names include <tt>errno</tt>, <tt>setjmp(jmpbuf)</tt>, and 
<tt>va_end(va_list)</tt>. These names are all defines as macros, not entities with that name and external linkage.
<p/>
Are these footnotes intended by a normative extension to the list of reserved names with external linkage?  
If so, they should be promoted to the main text, as they are no longer a note.
<p/>
If they intend to serve as examples, it is not clear to me what principle is being shown, as there are many 
other macros that might be in a similar position, and I do not see how to follow the a principle that is being 
noted, and presumably follows from the normative text.
<p/>
I <em>think</em> this is intended to be a normative extension to the set of reserved names with external linkage, 
is limited to exactly those three named macros, so should be promoted as a non-note into the main text, but want 
to hear what LWG consensus is before drafting wording.

Set priority to 3 after reflector poll.
