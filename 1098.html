<p>
 In 20.10.4 [util.dynamic.safety], <tt>get_pointer_safety()</tt> purports
to define behavior for
 non-safely derived pointers (3.7.4.3 [basic.stc.dynamic.safety]).  However,
 the cited core-language section in paragraph 4 specifies undefined behavior
 for the use of such pointer values.  This seems an unfortunate near-contradiction.
 I suggest to specify the term <i>relaxed pointer safety</i> in
 the core language section and refer to it from the library description.
 This issue deals with the library part, the corresponding core issue (c++std-core-13940)
 deals with the core modifications.

<p>
We recommend if this issue is to be moved,
the issue be moved concurrently with the cited Core issue.

<p>
We agree with the intent of the proposed resolution.
We would like input from garbage collection specialists.

<p>
Move to Open.

<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
In 20.10.4 [util.dynamic.safety] p16, replace the description of
<tt>get_pointer_safety()</tt> with:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<tt>pointer_safety get_pointer_safety();</tt>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<del><i>Returns:</i> an enumeration value indicating the implementation's treatment
of pointers that are not safely derived (3.7.4.3). Returns
<tt>pointer_safety::relaxed</tt> if pointers that are not safely derived will be
treated the same as pointers that are safely derived for the duration of
the program. Returns <tt>pointer_safety::preferred</tt> if pointers that are not
safely derived will be treated the same as pointers that are safely
derived for the duration of the program but allows the implementation to
hint that it could be desirable to avoid dereferencing pointers that are
not safely derived as described. [<i>Example:</i> <tt>pointer_safety::preferred</tt>
might be returned to detect if a leak detector is running to avoid
spurious leak reports. -- <i>end note</i>] Returns <tt>pointer_safety::strict</tt> if
pointers that are not safely derived might be treated differently than
pointers that are safely derived.</del>
</p>
<p><ins>
<i>Returns:</i> Returns <tt>pointer_safety::strict</tt> if the implementation has
   strict pointer safety (3.7.4.3 [basic.stc.dynamic.safety]). It is
   implementation-defined whether <tt>get_pointer_safety</tt> returns
   <tt>pointer_safety::relaxed</tt> or <tt>pointer_safety::preferred</tt> if the
   implementation has relaxed pointer safety
   (3.7.4.3 [basic.stc.dynamic.safety]).<sup>Footnote</sup>
</ins></p>

<p><ins>
<i>Throws:</i> nothing
</ins></p>

<p><ins>
Footnote) <tt>pointer_safety::preferred</tt> might be returned to indicate to the
   program that a leak detector is running so that the program can avoid
   spurious leak reports.
