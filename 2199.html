<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
The default constructor, allocator-aware constructor, and range-based constructors
for the unordered containers do not offer a means to control the initial
<tt>max_load_factor</tt>, so the standard mandates the value 1.0.  This seems overly
restrictive, as there is plenty of research suggesting a value between 0.5 and 1.0
is more often optimal for unique-key containers, and perhaps a slightly higher
value might be appropriate for multi-containers.
</p>
<p>
Rather than guess at the appropriate <tt>max_load_factor</tt>, it seems reasonable
that the standard should allow vendors to pick a value at their discretion, with
perhaps a note of advice.  It is less clear whether the default value should be
implementation-defined or unspecified, given the ease of a user determining this
by querying this attribute immediately after construction.

<p>
Moved to Open.
</p>
<p>
Alisdair to provide wording.
</p>
<p>
Marshall: It seems to me that what you really want is to be able to pass a max load factor in the
constructor, but that's a different issue.
</p>
<p>
Alisdair agrees in principle, but concerned with adding yet more constructors to these classes.

<p>NAD - if someone wants to come back with a paper exploring design alternatives, we can re-open.</p>
