<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>Paragraph 2 of 17.6.4.3.2 [macro.names] reads: &quot;A
translation unit that includes a header shall not contain any macros
that define names declared in that header.&quot; As I read this, it
would mean that the following program is legal:</p>

<pre>
  #define npos 3.14
  #include &lt;sstream&gt;
</pre>

<p>since npos is not defined in &lt;sstream&gt;.  It is, however, defined
in &lt;string&gt;, and it is hard to imagine an implementation in
which &lt;sstream&gt; didn't include &lt;string&gt;.</p>

<p>I think that this phrase was probably formulated before it was
decided that a standard header may freely include other standard
headers.  The phrase would be perfectly appropriate for C, for
example.  In light of 17.6.5.2 [res.on.headers] paragraph 1, however,
it isn't stringent enough.</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>For 17.6.4.3.2 [macro.names], replace the current wording, which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
     <p>Each name defined as a macro in a header is reserved to the
     implementation for any use if the translation unit includes
     the header.168)</p>

     <p>A translation unit that includes a header shall not contain any
     macros that define names declared or defined in that header. Nor shall
     such a translation unit define macros for names lexically
     identical to keywords.</p>

     <p>168) It is not permissible to remove a library macro definition by
     using the #undef directive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>with the wording:</p>

<blockquote>
     <p>A translation unit that includes a standard library header shall not
     #define or #undef names declared in any standard library header.</p>

     <p>A translation unit shall not #define or #undef names lexically
     identical to keywords.</p>
</blockquote>
