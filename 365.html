<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Some stream and streambuf member functions are declared non-const,
even thought they appear only to report information rather than to
change an object's logical state.  They should be declared const.  See
document N1360 for details and rationale.
</p>

<p>The list of member functions under discussion: <tt>in_avail</tt>,
<tt>showmanyc</tt>, <tt>tellg</tt>, <tt>tellp</tt>, <tt>is_open</tt>.</p>

<p>Related issue: <a href="lwg-closed.html#73">73</a></p>



<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>In 27.8.1.5, 27.8.1.7, 27.8.1.8, 27.8.1.10, 27.8.1.11, and 27.8.1.13</p>
<p>Replace</p>
<pre>
  bool is_open();
</pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre>
  bool is_open() const;
</pre>


<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>Of the changes proposed in N1360, the only one that is safe is
changing the filestreams' is_open to const.  The LWG believed that
this was NAD the first time it considered this issue (issue <a href="lwg-closed.html#73">73</a>), but now thinks otherwise.  The corresponding streambuf
member function, after all,is already const.</p>

<p>The other proposed changes are less safe, because some streambuf
functions that appear merely to report a value do actually perform
mutating operations.  It's not even clear that they should be
considered "logically const", because streambuf has two interfaces, a
public one and a protected one.  These functions may, and often do,
change the state as exposed by the protected interface, even if the
state exposed by the public interface is unchanged.</p>

<p>Note that implementers can make this change in a binary compatible
way by providing both overloads; this would be a conforming extension.</p>
