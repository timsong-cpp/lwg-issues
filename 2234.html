<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
It is unclear from the current specification whether <tt>assert()</tt> expressions can be used in 
(potential) constant expressions. As an example consider the implementation of a <tt>constexpr</tt>
function:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;cassert&gt;

template&lt;class T, unsigned N&gt;
struct array {
  T data[N];
  constexpr const T&amp; operator[](unsigned i) const {
    return assert(i &lt; N), data[i];
  }
};

int main() {
  constexpr array&lt;int, 3&gt; ai = {1, 2, 3};
  constexpr int i = ai[0];
  int j = ai[0];
  // constexpr int k = ai[5];
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The first question is whether this program is guaranteed well-formed? A second question is whether is would guaranteed to be
ill-formed, if we uncomment the last code line in <tt>main()</tt>?
</p>

<p>
The wording in 19.3 [assertions] doesn't add anything significant to the C99 wording. From the C99 specification 
(7.2 p1 and 7.2.1.1 p2) we get already some valuable guarantees:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
The expression <tt>assert(e)</tt> is a <tt>void</tt> expression for all expressions <tt>e</tt> independent of 
the definition of <tt>NDEBUG</tt>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
If <tt>NDEBUG</tt> is defined, <tt>assert(e)</tt> is equivalent to the expression <tt>void()</tt>
(or anything that cannot be distinguished from that).
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
The current wording does not yet <em>guarantee</em> that <tt>assert</tt> expressions can be used in constant expressions,
but all tested implementations (gcc, MSVC) would already support this use-case. It seems to me that this should be possible
without giving <tt>assert</tt> a special meaning for the core language.
<p/>
As a related comment it should be added, that there is a core language 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3444.html">proposal</a> 
that intents to relax some current constraints for <tt>constexpr</tt> functions and <tt>literal</tt> types. The most 
interesting one (making <tt>void</tt> a literal types and allowing for expression-statements) would simplify the motivating 
example implementation of <tt>operator[]</tt> to:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
constexpr const T&amp; operator[](unsigned i) const {
  assert(i &lt; N);
  return data[i];
};
</pre></blockquote>

<p><i>[2013-03-15 Issues Teleconference]</i></p>

<p>
Moved to Open.
</p>
<p>
We are still gaining experience with <tt>constexpr</tt> as a language feature, and there may
be work in Evolution that would help address some of these concerns.  Defer discussion until
we have a group familiar with any evolutionary direction.
</p>

<p><i>[2014-06-08, Daniel comments and suggests wording]</i></p>

<p>
After approval of <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3652.html"/>N3652<a/>,
<tt>void</tt> is now a literal type and <tt>constexpr</tt> functions can contain multiple statements, so
this makes the guarantee that <tt>assert</tt> expressions are per-se <tt>constexpr</tt>-friendly even more
relevant. A possible wording form could be along the lines of:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For every core constant expression <em>e</em> of scalar type that evaluates to <tt>true</tt> after being contextually 
converted to <tt>bool</tt>, the expression <tt>assert(<em>e</em>)</tt> shall be a prvalue core constant expression of type 
<tt>void</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Richard Smith pointed out some weaknesses of this wording form, for example it would not guarantee to require
the following example to work:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
constexpr void check(bool b) { assert(b); }
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
because <tt>b</tt> is not a core constant expression in this context.
<p/>
He suggested improvements that lead to the wording form presented below (any defects mine). 
</p>

<p><i>[Lenexa 2015-05-05]</i></p>

<p>
MC : ran into this<br/>
Z : Is it guaranteed to be an expression?<br/>
MC : clarifies that assert runs at runtime, not sure what it does at compile time<br/>
STL : c standard guarantees its an expression and not a whole statement, so comma chaining it is ok<br/>
HH : Some implementations work as author wants it to<br/>
STL : also doing this as constexpr<br/>
DK/STL : discussing how this can actually work<br/>
HH : GCC 5 also implements it. We have implementor convergence<br/>
MC : Wants to do this without giving assert a special meaning<br/>
STL : NDEBUG being defined where assert appears is not how assert works. This is bug in wording. Should be "when assert is defined" or something like that. ... is a constant subexpression if NDEBUG is defined at the point where assert is last defined or redefined."<br/>
Would like to strike the "either" because ok if both debug or assertion is true. We want inclusive-or here<br/>
MC : is redefined needed?<br/>
STL : my mental model is its defined once and then redefined<br/>
HH : wants to up to P2<br/>
Z/STL : discussing how wording takes care of how/when assert is defined/redefefined<br/>
STL/WB : discussing whether to move to ready or review. -> Want to move it to ready.<br/>
ask for updated wording<br/>
p3 -> p2<br/>
plan to go to ready after checking wording<br/>
</p>

<p><i>[Telecom 2015-06-30]</i></p>

<p>
HH: standardizing existing practice<br/>
MC: what about the comment from Lenexa about striking "either"?<br/>
HH: all three implementations accept it<br/>
MC: update issue to strike "either" and move to Tentatively Ready<br/>
