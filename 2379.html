<p>
Class <tt>thread</tt> contains an implementation-defined type <tt>thread::native_handle_type</tt>, and an implementation-defined 
function <tt>thread::native_handle()</tt> that returns a value of that type. The presence and semantics of those members is 
implementation-defined; the intention is that they can be used for interoperability with libraries that rely on operating system 
specific features. (Posix libraries that accept arguments of type <tt>pthread_t</tt>, for example.)
<p/>
Unfortunately, there appears to be no native handle support for the equivalent of <tt>pthread_self()</tt>. We can use 
<tt>this_thread::get_id()</tt> to obtain the <tt>thread::id</tt> of the current thread, but there is no mechanism for converting 
a <tt>thread::id</tt> to a <tt>thread::native_handle</tt>.
<p/>
<em>Proposed wording:</em>
<p/>
In 30.3.2 [thread.thread.this] add:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
thread::native_handle_type native_handle(); <i>// See 30.2.3</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
 to the <tt>this_thread</tt> namespace synopsis.
<p/>
<em>Rationale:</em>
<p/>
Informally, we could address this issue either by adding a new function in <tt>this_thread</tt> or by providing a mechanism for converting 
between <tt>thread::id</tt> and <tt>thread::native_handle</tt>. I propose the former because it seems more localized, and doesn't involve 
saying anything more about implementation defined native functionality than we currently do.
<p/>
It's intentional that the proposed resolution adds a declaration of <tt>native_handle()</tt> without adding a paragraph explaining what 
it does. This is because everything about <tt>native_handle()</tt> is implementation-defined. The standard does the same thing in 
30.3.1.5 [thread.thread.member]. 
</p>

<p><i>[2015-02 Cologne]</i></p>

<p>
Handed over to SG1.
</p>

<p><i>[2015-05 Lenexa, SG1 response]</i></p>

<p>
Strong "don't care" reaction from SG1, after pointing out that this only matters in non-portable code, which can call pthread_self() or the like anyway, but the change also doesn't add any non-trivial implementation requirements.  This defused initial strong opinions on both sides.  Since this is essentially a feature request, we did not have sufficient consensus to proceed at this point.  There was a feeling we should reconsider after making more sense out of the much more general TLS issues we have been discussing.

<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>This wording is relative to N3936.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change 30.2.3 [thread.req.native] p1 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-1- <del>Several classes described in this Clause have members</del><ins>This Clause includes several members named</ins> 
<tt>native_handle_type</tt> and <tt>native_handle</tt>. The presence of these members and their semantics is 
implementation-defined. [&hellip;]
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>In 30.3 [thread.threads], header <tt>&lt;thread&gt;</tt> synopsis, add:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
namespace std {
  [&hellip;]
  namespace this_thread {
    thread::id get_id() noexcept;
    <ins>thread::native_handle_type native_handle();</ins>
    [&hellip;]
  }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>In 30.3.2 [thread.thread.this] add:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
namespace std {
  namespace this_thread {
    thread::id get_id() noexcept;
    <ins>thread::native_handle_type native_handle(); <i>// See 30.2.3 [thread.req.native]</i></ins>
    [&hellip;]
  }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
