N3936 16.4.6.9 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/reentrancy">[reentrancy]</a>/1 talks about "functions", but that doesn't address the scenario of calling different member
functions of a single object. Member functions often have to violate and then re-establish invariants. For example, vectors
often have "holes" during insertion, and element constructors/destructors/etc. shouldn't be allowed to observe the vector
while it's in this invariant-violating state. The [reentrancy] Standardese should be extended to cover member functions,
so that implementers can either say that member function reentrancy is universally prohibited, or selectively allowed for
very specific scenarios.
<p/>
(For clarity, this issue has been split off from LWG <a href="2382">2382</a>.)

<p><i>[2014-11-03 Urbana]</i></p>

<p>
AJM confirmed with SG1 that they had no special concerns with this issue, and LWG should retain ownership.
<p/>
AM: this is too overly broad as it also covers calling the exact same member function on a different object<br/>
STL: so you insert into a map, and copying the value triggers another insertion into a different map of the same type<br/>
GR: reentrancy seems to imply the single-threaded case, but needs to consider the multi-threaded case
<p/>
Needs more wording.

<p><i>[2015-07 Telecon Urbana]</i></p>

<p>Marshall to ping STL for updated wording.<br/></p>

<p><i>[2016-05 email from STL]</i></p>

<p>I don't have any better suggestions than my original PR at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>Previous resolution [SUPERSEDED]:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="note">

<p>This wording is relative to N3936.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change 16.4.6.9 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/reentrancy">[reentrancy]</a> p1 as indicated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
-1- Except where explicitly specified in this standard, it is implementation-defined which functions <ins>(including different
member functions called on a single object)</ins> in the Standard C++ library may be recursively reentered.
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><i>[2021-07-29 Tim suggests new wording]</i></p>

<p>
The "<tt>this</tt> pointer" restriction is modeled on 11.9.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/class.cdtor">[class.cdtor]</a> p2.
It allows us to continue to specify a member function <tt>f</tt> as calling some other
member function <tt>g</tt>, since any such call would use something obtained
from the first member function's <tt>this</tt> pointer.
<p/>
In all other cases, this wording disallows such "recursion on object" unless both
member functions are <tt>const</tt> (or are treated as such for the
purposes of data race avoidance). Using "access" means that we also cover direct
access to the object representation, such as the following pathological example
<a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2021/04/17/pathological-string-appends/">from Arthur O'Dwyer</a>,
which is now undefined:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
std::string s = "hello world";
char *first = (char*)&amp;s;
char *last = (char*)(&amp;s + 1);
s.append(first, last);
</pre>
</blockquote>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>This wording is relative to <a href="https://wg21.link/N4892">N4892</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add the following paragraph to 16.4.6.9 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/reentrancy">[reentrancy]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<ins>-?- During the execution of a standard library non-static member function <i>F</i> on an object,
if that object is accessed through a glvalue that is not obtained, directly or indirectly, from
the <tt>this</tt> pointer of <i>F</i>, in a manner that can conflict (6.9.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.races">[intro.races]</a>)
with any access that <i>F</i> is permitted to perform (16.4.6.10 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/res.on.data.races">[res.on.data.races]</a>),
the behavior is undefined unless otherwise specified.</ins>
