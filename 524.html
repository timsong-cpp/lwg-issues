<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
This defect is also being discussed on the Boost developers list. The 
full discussion can be found here:

<p>
Also, I may have found another issue, closely related to the one under
discussion. It regards case-insensitive matching of named character
classes. The regex_traits&lt;&gt; provides two functions for working with
named char classes: lookup_classname and isctype. To match a char class
such as [[:alpha:]], you pass "alpha" to lookup_classname and get a
bitmask. Later, you pass a char and the bitmask to isctype and get a
bool yes/no answer.
</p>
<p>
But how does case-insensitivity work in this scenario? Suppose we're
doing a case-insensitive match on [[:lower:]]. It should behave as if it
were [[:lower:][:upper:]], right? But there doesn't seem to be enough
smarts in the regex_traits interface to do this.
</p>
<p>
Imagine I write a traits class which recognizes [[:fubar:]], and the
"fubar" char class happens to be case-sensitive. How is the regex engine
to know that? And how should it do a case-insensitive match of a
character against the [[:fubar:]] char class? John, can you confirm this
is a legitimate problem?
</p>
<p>
I see two options:
</p>
<p>
1) Add a bool icase parameter to lookup_classname. Then,
lookup_classname( "upper", true ) will know to return lower|upper
instead of just upper.
</p>
<p>
2) Add a isctype_nocase function
</p>
<p>
I prefer (1) because the extra computation happens at the time the
pattern is compiled rather than when it is executed.
</p>

<p>
For what it's worth, John has also expressed his preference for option 
(1) above.
