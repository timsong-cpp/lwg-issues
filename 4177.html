<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
32.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p8 and p9 gave two paradigmatic examples of how "circularly depend on 
their own computation" means. However, consider this example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::atomic&lt;int&gt; x = 0, y = 2;

// thread 1:
if (y.load(relaxed) == 1) { // #1
  x.store(1, relaxed); // #2
}

//thread 2:
int pre = x.load(relaxed); // #3
while (pre != 0) {
  if (x.compare_exchange_strong(pre, pre + 1, acquire, relaxed)) {  // #4
    break;
  }
}
y.store(1, relaxed); // #5
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
when both <code class='backtick'>#1</code> and <code class='backtick'>#3</code> read <code class='backtick'>1</code>, is this a kind of OOTA? <code class='backtick'>#3</code> depends on <code class='backtick'>#2</code>, <code class='backtick'>#2</code> depends on <code class='backtick'>#1</code>, 
<code class='backtick'>#1</code> depends on <code class='backtick'>#5</code>, and the execution of <code class='backtick'>#5</code> depends on the exiting of the loop, which in turn initially 
depends on <code class='backtick'>pre</code>.
<p/>
The loop can never execute, exit after certain iterations, or be a long-time-running without exiting 
(i.e. <code class='backtick'>cmpxchg</code> keeps failing). So, it is unclear whether the execution of <code class='backtick'>#5</code> depends on the loop. 
However, it resembles the <code class='backtick'>spin-loop</code> (a failed <code class='backtick'>cmpxchg</code> is a pure load with a relaxed load), and the 
subsequent codes won't execute until the loop exits. So, the scenario of spin-lock seems to agree that 
the code after a loop depends on the loop(regardless of whether the loop can quickly exit or be a 
long-time-run loop).
<p/>
From this perspective, the <code class='backtick'>while</code> case is something like the <code class='backtick'>if</code>, for <code class='backtick'>if</code>, the condition is not 
<code class='backtick'>true</code>, and the code thereof cannot be executed. Similarly, a code after a while cannot be executed 
if the loop doesn't exit.
<p/>
<b>Suggested resolution:</b>
<p/>
 Either accurately specify what "circularly depend on their own computation" means, or add a paradigmatic 
 example regarding loop to indicate what it means.
</p>

<p><i>[Additional discussion from submitter:]</i></p>

<p>
I meant, that for a classic spin-lock, the code after the loop won't be
executed until the loop exits, and the operation is just a pure load with
relaxed memory order during the busy wait.
The loop for a spin-lock can have three possible cases:
<ol>
<li>CAS immediately succeeds </li>
<li>the loop exits after certain times of iterations</li>
<li>the loop cannot be exited(e.g. the lock is not released)</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The compiler cannot assume which case the loop for the spin-lock is.
The code after the loop won't be reordered(during the busy waiting with
a relaxed memory order); otherwise, implementing the spin-lock would be
an issue based on the assumption that the codes after the loop wouldn't
be reached when the loop was busy waiting.
</p>
<p>
In this example, the loop has the same possible cases as the loop
in the spin-lock. So, the execution of <code class='backtick'>#5</code> seems to depend on the loop
and the loop depends on the <code class='backtick'>pre</code>. why I mention the spin-lock just is to
justify that the code after the loop won't be reordered in both compile-time
and runtime even though the condition of the loop is a pure load with a relaxed
memory order(otherwise, the foundation for which the busy-waiting of a
spink-lock is based on won't be true.). So, the loop has a similar effect
to the <code class='backtick'>if</code> statement on the control flow: the code in the block of
the <code class='backtick'>if</code> statement won't be executed if the condition is false, as well,
the code after the loop won't be executed if the loop hasn't yet exited.
</p>

<p><i>[2025-02-07; Reflector poll]</i></p>

<p>
Set priority to 4 after reflector poll. Send to SG1.
</p>
<p>
"Should the example use <code class='backtick'>unsigned</code> so there's no chance of UB due to <code class='backtick'>int</code>
overflowing?"
</p>
<p>
"Contrived example showing well-known fact that OOTA prohibition is just
hand-waving. <a href="https://wg21.link/N3786" title=" Prohibiting &quot;out of thin air&quot; results in C++14">N3786</a> introduced the current wording and made
no secret of that. <a href="https://wg21.link/P1217" title=" Out-of-thin-air, revisited, again">P1217</a> explored the issue further,
as have other SG1 papers. Hard problems. Solutions welcome. Don't think this
is the place to focus however."
