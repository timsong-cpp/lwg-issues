<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Following a discussion on the boost list regarding end iterators and
the possibility of performing operator--() on them, it seems to me
that there is a typo in the standard.  This typo has nothing to do
with that discussion.
</p>

<p>
I have checked this newsgroup, as well as attempted a search of the
Active/Defect/Closed Issues List on the site for the words "s is
derefer" so I believe this has not been proposed before.  Furthermore,
the "Lists by Index" mentions only DR <a href="299">299</a> on section
24.1.4, and DR <a href="299">299</a> is not related to this issue.
</p>

<p>
The standard makes the following assertion on bidirectional iterators,
in section 24.1.4 [lib.bidirectional.iterators], Table 75:
</p>

<pre>
                         operational  assertion/note
expression  return type   semantics    pre/post-condition

--r          X&amp;                        pre: there exists s such
                                       that r == ++s.
                                       post: s is dereferenceable.
                                       --(++r) == r.
                                       --r == --s implies r == s.
                                       &amp;r == &amp;--r.
</pre>

<p>
(See <a href="http://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/2002/10/37636.php">http://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/2002/10/37636.php</a>.)
</p>

<p>
In particular, "s is dereferenceable" seems to be in error.  It seems
that the intention was to say "r is dereferenceable".
</p>

<p>
If it were to say "r is dereferenceable" it would
make perfect sense.  Since s must be dereferenceable prior to
operator++, then the natural result of operator-- (to undo operator++)
would be to make r dereferenceable.  Furthermore, without other
assertions, and basing only on precondition and postconditions, we
could not otherwise know this.  So it is also interesting information.
</p>



<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
Change the guarantee to "postcondition: r is dereferenceable."
</p>


<p><b>Rationale:</b></p><p>Fixes an obvious typo</p>
