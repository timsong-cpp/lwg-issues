<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
After the additions by <a href="2033">2033</a>, it appears clear that the intended effect includes a reallocation and 
thus the potential effect on iterators should be explicitly added to the text in order to not contradict 
23.2.1 [container.requirements.general]/11, or at the very least, explicitly state that a reallocation may 
happen.
<p/>
Taking consistency with "reserve" into consideration, I propose:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
that the current "Remarks" are made its "Effect" instead, inserting "Reallocation happens at this point if and only 
if the function effectively reduces the capacity." after the note on non-bindingness.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
adding a "Remarks" paragraph, similar to that of reserve: "Reallocation invalidates all the references, pointers, 
and iterators referring to the elements in the sequence."
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
BTW, while we are at it, I believe the effect on iterators should also be explicitly stated in the other instance 
a reallocation may happen: 23.3.11.5 [vector.modifiers]/1 &mdash; even if obvious, it only contradicts 
23.2.1 [container.requirements.general]/11 implicitly. 
<p/>
I propose to also insert "Reallocation invalidates all the references, pointers, and iterators referring to the 
elements in the sequence." at the appropriate location in its "Remarks".

<p>
The described problem also affects <tt>std::basic_string</tt> and <tt>std::deque</tt>.
</p>

<p><i>[2013-03-15 Issues Teleconference]</i></p>

<p>
Moved to Review.
</p>

<p><i>[2013-04-18, Bristol]</i></p>
 

<p>Daniel extends the P/R.</p>

<p>Rationale:</p>

<p>The wording in 21.3.1.4 [string.capacity] combined with 21.3.1.1 [string.require]
seems to say the necessary things. We cannot impose all requirements as we do for <tt>vector</tt>, because
we want to allow the short-string-optimization.</p>


<p><i>[2014-02-15 post-Issaquah session]</i></p>

<p>
STL: I think that <tt>shrink_to_fit</tt> should be a no-op when called twice.
</p>
<p>
STL: Do we ever define reallocation for <tt>deque</tt>? Nope, all mentions of "reallocation" are in <tt>vector</tt>.
     We define what it means in <tt>vector::reserve()</tt>, but not for <tt>deque</tt>.
</p>
<p>
STL: Oh duh, they define reallocate in the PR. But I think we can do better here.
</p>
<p>
STL: Optimally, deque shrinking just allocates a new map of pointers, and drops empty blocks, but preserves pointers/references to elements.
</p>
<p>
Alisdair: That's like unordered containers, invalidating only iterators.
</p>
<p>
Pablo: It doesn't make sense to reduce <tt>capacity()</tt> to <tt>size()</tt>, because <tt>deque</tt> doesn't have capacity!
</p>
<p>
STL: For <tt>vector</tt>, "effectively reduces the capacity" is unnecessary, the capacity there is observable.
</p>
<p>
STL: There is a strong reason to provide an optimal shrink to fit for <tt>deque</tt>, since only the library implementer can do this.
</p>
<p>
STL: The other thing I don't like the repeated definition of reallocation for <tt>vector</tt>, we define it once and use it in a bunch of places.
     At most we can lift it up to the <tt>vector</tt> synopsis.
</p>
<p>
STL: I'll write new wording.
</p>

<p><i>[2014-10-01, STL adds discussion and provides new wording]</i></p>

<p>
Compared to the previous proposed resolution:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
I'm changing <tt>basic_string</tt>'s wording because (1) we should guarantee that capacity won't increase, (2) we should mention 
that it's linear complexity, and (3) we can provide a better invalidation guarantee than 21.3.1.1 [string.require]/5.  
(As previously noted, we already have the strong exception guarantee.) This introduces the term "reallocation" into 
<tt>basic_string</tt>, but immediately explains what it means for iterator validity. As far as I can tell, the Small String 
Optimization doesn't complicate the wording here; it's a reason why an implementation might not honor the request, but if 
the capacity is reduced, we are definitely reallocating buffers and will invalidate everything (including when the destination 
is the small buffer).
</p></li>
<li><p>
Between N3485 and N3936, <tt>deque</tt>'s wording was updated to avoid talking about <tt>capacity()</tt> which it doesn't have.  
Since the container's capacity is unobservable, I'm saying that invalidation is unconditional.
</p></li>
<li><p>
In <tt>vector</tt>'s wording, I'm also guaranteeing that capacity won't increase, and that iterators/etc. remain valid if the 
capacity is unchanged.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
My wording doesn't directly say that <tt>shrink_to_fit()</tt> should be a no-op when called twice in a row. (Indirectly, 
if the first call reduces <tt>capacity()</tt> to <tt>size()</tt>, the second call must preserve iterators/etc.) I considered 
rewording the complexity to say "linear if reallocation happens", but that's potentially problematic (what if we copy almost 
all <tt>N</tt> elements, then one throws and we have to unwind? There are no effects, so reallocation didn't happen, yet we 
took longer than constant time). Implementers can always do better than the stated complexity bounds.
<p/>
I chose not to modify <tt>deque</tt>'s requirements, so implementations remain free to reallocate the elements themselves.
<p/>
I didn't attempt to centralize vector's reallocation wording. That can be done editorially, if someone is sufficiently motivated.

<p><i>[2015-02 Cologne]</i></p>

<p>
GR: I'm concerned that <tt>shrink_to_fit</tt> may cause reallocation without changing the capacity. [&hellip;] 
It's about correctness. The statement about invalidation is useless if I cannot detect whether reallocation has happened?
<p/>
AM: It seems like the logic goes the other way round: It's the capacity change that causes reallocation, so if 
there's no capacity change, there's no reallocation. But that's not quite how I'd like to say it... maybe this, : 
"If capacity does not change, no reallocation occurs."
<p/>
GR: Where does it actually say that <tt>reserve()</tt> invalidates? AM: It should say that in the container requirements. 
VV: vector specifies in <tt>reserve</tt> that there's reallocation if and only if the capacity changes. GR: I can't find
anything in the container requirements about <tt>reserve</tt>. DK: No, it's specified for every container separately. 
GR: It isn't specified for string.
<p/>
GR: I'm noticing that the issue touches on <tt>shrink_to_fit</tt> for a bunch of containers. Anyway, I think the 
reserve issue [re string] is in scope for this issue. This change is touching on a lot of members.
<p/>
AM: Landing this change will provide clarity for what we should do with <tt>basic_string</tt>. GR: We're already asking 
for changes; we should fix string as well. AM: If one of the changes is ready before the other, I'd like to land the 
finished part first, but if both are ready for Lenexa, I'm equally happy to fix them in one go.
<p/>
DK will reword this. 
<p/>
<b>Conclusion</b>: Update wording, revisit in Lenexa.
