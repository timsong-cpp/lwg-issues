<p>
I'm not sure how many of those reserve naming patterns that might affect
us, but I am equally sure I don't own a copy of any of these to check!
</p>
<p>
The point is to list the reserved naming patterns, rather than the
individual names themselves - although we may want to list C keywords
that are valid identifiers in C++ but likely to cause trouble in shared
headers (e.g. restrict)
</p>

<p><i>[
Kona (2007): Recommend NAD.  No one has identified a specific defect, just the possibility of one.

<p><i>[
Post-Kona: Alisdair request Open. A good example of the problem was a
discussion of the system error proposal, where it was pointed out an all-caps
identifier starting with a capital E conflicted with reserved macro names for
both Posix and C.  I had absolutely no idea of this rule, and suspect I was
not the only one in the room.<br/>
<br/>
Resolution will require someone with access to all the listed documents to
research their respective name reservation rules, or people with access to
specific documents add their rules to this issue until the list is complete.

<p><i>[
Bellevue: Wording is aleady present in various standards, and no-one has come forward with wording.
Suggest a formal paper rather than a defect report is the correct way to proceed.
