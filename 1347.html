<p>
Since the newly introduced operator <tt>noexcept</tt> makes it
easy (easier than previously) to detect whether or not a
function has been declared with the empty exception
specification (including <tt>noexcept</tt>) library functions that
cannot throw should be decorated with the empty
exception specification. Failing to do so and leaving it as a
matter of QoI would be detrimental to portability and
efficiency.
</p>

Resolution proposed by ballot comment

<p>
Review the whole library, and apply the <tt>noexcept</tt>
specification where it is appropriate.

<p>
While the LWG expects to see further papers in this area, sufficient action was taken in Batavia to close the issue as Resolved by the listed papers.
