<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>Throughout the library chapters, the descriptions of library entities refer
to other library entities without necessarily qualifying the names.</p>

<p>For example, section 25.2.2 &quot;Swap&quot; describes the effect of
swap_ranges in terms of the unqualified name &quot;swap&quot;. This section
could reasonably be interpreted to mean that the library must be implemented so
as to do a lookup of the unqualified name &quot;swap&quot;, allowing users to
override any ::std::swap function when Koenig lookup applies.</p>

<p>Although it would have been best to use explicit qualification with
&quot;::std::&quot; throughout, too many lines in the standard would have to be
adjusted to make that change in a Technical Corrigendum.</p>

<p>Issue <a href="182" title="Ambiguous references to size_t (Status: CD1)">182</a>, which addresses qualification of
<code>size_t</code>, is a special case of this.
</p>


<p id="res-229"><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>To section 17.4.1.1 &quot;Library contents&quot; Add the following paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Whenever a name x defined in the standard library is mentioned, the name x
  is assumed to be fully qualified as ::std::x, unless explicitly described
  otherwise. For example, if the Effects section for library function F is
  described as calling library function G, the function ::std::G is meant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>[Post-Tokyo: Steve Clamage submitted this issue at the request of
the LWG to solve a problem in the standard itself similar to the
problem within implementations of library identified by issue <a href="225" title="std:: algorithms use of other unqualified algorithms (Status: CD1)">225</a>.  Any resolution of issue <a href="225" title="std:: algorithms use of other unqualified algorithms (Status: CD1)">225</a> should be
coordinated with the resolution of this issue.]</i></p>


<p><i>[post-Toronto: Howard is undecided about whether it is
appropriate for all standard library function names referred to in
other standard library functions to be explicitly qualified by
<code>std</code>: it is common advice that users should define global
functions that operate on their class in the same namespace as the 
class, and this requires argument-dependent lookup if those functions
are intended to be called by library code.  Several LWG members are
concerned that valarray appears to require argument-dependent lookup,
but that the wording may not be clear enough to fall under
&quot;unless explicitly described otherwise&quot;.]</i></p>


<p><i>[Cura&ccedil;ao: An LWG-subgroup spent an afternoon working on issues
225, 226, and 229.  Their conclusion was that the issues should be
separated into an LWG portion (Howard's paper, N1387=02-0045), and a
EWG portion (Dave will write a proposal). The LWG and EWG had
(separate) discussions of this plan the next day.  This paper resolves
issues 225 and 226.  In light of that resolution, the proposed
resolution for the current issue makes sense.]</i></p>
