<p><b>Addresses UK 150</b></p>

<p>
There is on going confusion over what one can and can not do with a moved-from
object (e.g.
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n3009.html#UK150">UK 150</a>,
<a href="910">910</a>).
This issue attempts to clarify that moved-from objects are valid objects with an
unknown state.

<p>
I'm afraid I must register an objection.
</p>

<p>
My primary objection is that I have always been opposed to this kind of a
resolution as over-constraining.  My preferred example is a call implementing
the pImpl idiom via <tt>unique_ptr</tt>.  Once the pImpl has been moved from, it
is no longer safe to call the vast majority of the object's methods, yet I see
no reason to make such a type unusable in the standard library.  I would prefer
a resolution along the lines suggested in the UK comment, which only requires
that the object can be safely destroyed, and serve as the target of an
assignment operator (if supported.)
</p>

<p>
However, I will not hold the issue up if I am a lone dissenting voice on this
(yes, that is a call to hear more support, or I will drop that objection in
Pittsburgh)
</p>

<p>
With the proposed wording, I'm not clear what the term 'valid object' means.  In
my example above, is a pImpl holding a null pointer 'valid'?  What about a float
holding a signalling NaN?  What determines if an object is valid?  Without a
definition of a valid/invalid object, I don't think this wording adds anything,
and this is an objection that I do want resolved.

<p>
This issue is now addressed by <a href="1309">1309</a>.

<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
Change the follwing tables in 16.4.4.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/utility.arg.requirements">[utility.arg.requirements]</a> as shown:
</p>

<blockquote>

<td>
<tt>t</tt> is equivalent to the value of <tt>rv</tt> before the construction.
