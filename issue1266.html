<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
If a <tt>shared_future</tt> is constructed with the result of an <tt>async</tt> call with a
deferred function, and two or more copies of that <tt>shared_future</tt> are created,
with multiple threads calling <tt>get()</tt>, it is not clear which thread runs the
deferred function. 30.6.7 [futures.shared_future]p22 from
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n3000.pdf">N3000</a>
says (minus editor's note):
</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Effects:</i> if the associated state contains a deferred function, executes
the deferred function. Otherwise, blocks until the associated state is ready.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
In the absence of wording to the contrary, this implies that every thread that
calls <tt>wait()</tt> will execute the deferred function.

<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>
Solved by
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3058.html">N3058</a>.
</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
Replace 30.6.7 [futures.shared_future]p22 with the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects:</i> If the associated state 
<del>contains a deferred function, executes the deferred function. Otherwise,
blocks until the associated state is ready.</del>
<ins>was created by a <tt>promise</tt> or <tt>packaged_task</tt> object, block
until the associated state is ready. If the associated state is associated with
a thread created for an <tt>async</tt> call (30.6.8 [futures.async]), as
if <tt>associated-thread.join()</tt>.
</ins></p>

<p><ins>
If the associated state contains a deferred function, calls to <tt>wait()</tt>
on all <tt>shared_future</tt> objects that share the same associated state are
serialized. The first call to <tt>wait()</tt> that shares a given associated
state executes the deferred function and stores the return value or exception in
the associated state.
</ins></p>

<p><ins>
<i>Synchronization:</i> if the associated state was created by a
<tt>promise</tt> object, the completion of <tt>set_value()</tt> or
<tt>set_exception()</tt> to that <tt>promise</tt> happens before (1.10 [intro.multithread]) <tt>wait()</tt> returns. If the associated state
was created by a <tt>packaged_task</tt> object, the completion of the associated
task happens before <tt>wait()</tt> returns. If the associated state is
associated with a thread created for an <tt>async</tt> call (30.6.8 [futures.async]), the completion of the associated thread happens-before
<tt>wait()</tt> returns.
</ins></p>

<p><ins>
If the associated state contained a deferred function, the invocation of the
deferred function happens-before any call to <tt>wait()</tt> on a
<tt>future</tt> that shares that state returns.
</ins></p>
