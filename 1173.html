Issue: The <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> requirements are wishy-washy.  It requires
that the copy is "equivalent" to the original, but "equivalent" is never
defined.
</p>
<p>
I believe this to be an example of a more general lack of rigor around
copy and assignment, although I haven't done the research to dig up all
the instances.
</p>
<p>
It's a problem because if you don't know what <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> means,
you also don't know what it means to copy a pair of <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>
types.  It doesn't prevent us from writing code, but it is a hole in our
ability to understand the meaning of copy.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, I'm pretty sure that vector's copy constructor doesn't
require the elements to be <tt>EqualityComparable</tt>, so that table is actually
referring to some ill-defined notion of equivalence when it uses ==.

Move to "Open". Dave is right that this is a big issue. Paper D2987
("Defining Move Special Member Functions", Bjarne Stroustrup and
Lawrence Crowl) touches on this but does not solve it. This issue is
discussed in Elements of Programming.

<blockquote><p>
This issue is quite vague, so it is difficult to know if and when it has been resolved.
John Lakos wrote a paper covering this area a while back, and there is a real interest 
in providing some sort of clean-up in the future. We need a more clearly draughted 
issues with an addressable set of concerns, ideally with a paper proposing a resolution, 
but for a future revision of the standard. Move to Tentatively NAD Future.
