<p>
The library provides several traits mechanisms intended a
customization points for users. Typically, they are
declared in headers that are growing quite large. This is
not a problem for standard library vendors, who can
manage their internal file structure to avoid large
dependencies, but can be a problem for end users who
have no option but to include these large headers.

<p>
There was no enthusiasm for touching <tt>char_traits</tt> or <tt>regex_traits</tt>.
Consensus to move <tt>iterator_traits</tt>, <tt>allocator_traits</tt>
and <tt>pointer_traits</tt> to their own respective headers once wording supplied.
</p>

<p><i>[

<p>
After some discussion, consensus is that moving these features into separate
headers does not buy much in practice, as the larger headers will inevitably
be included anyway.  Resolve as NAD.
</p>

<p><i>[
Resolution proposed in ballot comment
]</i></p>

<p>
Move the following traits classes into their own
headers, and require the existing header to
<tt>#include</tt> the traits header to support backwards
compatibility:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
iterator_traits (plus the iterator tag-types)
allocator_traits
pointer_traits
char_traits
regex_traits
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Closed as NAD with the rationale below.
</p>



<p><b>Rationale:</b></p><p>
This suggest is not a defect, as the likely benefit is small, if any,
compared to the cost of not just implementating the feature, but also
explaining/teaching it.
