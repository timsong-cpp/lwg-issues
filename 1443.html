<p><b>Addresses GB-122</b></p>

<p>At various points in the standard new edges are added to
happens-before, for example 27.2.3:2 adds happens-before edges between
writes and reads from a stream:</p>

<p>If one thread makes a library call a that writes a value to a
stream and, as a result, another thread reads this value from the
stream through a library call b such that this does not result in a
data race, then a happens before b.</p>

<p>Happens-before is defined in 1.10:11 in a deliberate way that makes it
not explicitly transitively closed. Adding edges to happens-before
directly, as in 27.2.3:2, does not provide transitivity with
sequenced-before or any other existing happens-before edge. This lack
of transitivity seems to be unintentional. In order to achieve
transitivity we suggest each edge be added to
inter-thread-happens-before as a synchronises-with edge (as per
conversation with Hans Boehm). In the standard, each use of the words
"happens-before" should be replaced with the words "synchronizes-with"
in the following sentences:</p>

<p>27.2.3:2,
30.3.1.2:6,
30.3.1.5:7,
30.6.4:7,
30.6.9:5,
30.6.10.1:23</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
Request the concurrency working group to
determine if changes are needed
