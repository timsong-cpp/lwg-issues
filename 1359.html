<p>
The <tt>&lt;utility&gt;</tt> header provides support for several
important C++ idioms with <tt>move</tt>, <tt>forward</tt> and <tt>swap</tt>.
Likewise, <tt>declval</tt> will be frequently used like a type trait.
In order to complete cycles introduced by <tt>std::pair</tt>, the
<tt>&lt;tuple&gt;</tt> header should also be made available. This is a
similarly primitive set of functionality, with no dependency
of a hosted environment, but does go beyond the minimal
set of functionality otherwise suggested by the
freestanding libraries.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, split the <tt>move</tt>/<tt>forward</tt>/<tt>swap</tt>/<tt>declval</tt>
functions out of <tt>&lt;utility&gt;</tt> and into a new primitive header,
requiring only that of freestanding implementation.
</p>

<p><i>[
Summary of Rapperswil discusions
]</i></p>

<p>
The preference of the meeting was to extract the rvalue-reference related utilities 
and swap into a freestanding header, but there was no clear preference for a name.  
Howard suggested simply dropping them into <tt>&lt;type_traits&gt;</tt> as both 
these utilities and type traits are used pretty much everywhere in the library 
implementation, it is the most convenient place to keep them (from an implementer's 
perspective).
</p>

<p>
Poll: Two-way: New header for forward, move, swap, move_with_noexcept and declval vs. 
calling out forward, move, swap, move_with_noexcept and declval as freestanding explicitly?

SF new header: 4 WF new header: 3 WF call out as freestanding: 1 SF call out as freestanding: 2

Alisdair: Willing to write up both solutions, give us some time to think on it.

Action: Need an issue and proposed wording for GB 56 - Alisdair to draft both options as in the last poll.

<blockquote>
<p>
Add <tt>&lt;utility&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;tuple&gt;</tt> to table 15, headers
required for a free-standing implementation.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>[
2010-Batavia:
]</i></p>

<p>
Closed as NAD, reversing the decision at Rapperswil.
</p>
<p>
The consensus was that
any freestanding implementation is going to feel compelled to offer the important
features of <tt>&lt;utility></tt> even if we do not make them a freestanding
requirement; breaking out additional small headers may have additional costs at
compile time, and while the critical <tt>move</tt>-related functions could migrate
to <tt>&lt;type_traits></tt>, the header name is far from appealing; adding the
whole of <tt>&lt;utility></tt> starts to drag in dependencies on <tt>&lt;tuple></tt>
and <tt>&lt;memory></tt>, so we prefer to place the burden of slicing or supporting
this whole header on free-standing vendors.
