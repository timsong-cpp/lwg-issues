<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>This issue is related to issue 242.  In case that the resolution
proposed for issue 242 is accepted, we have have the following
situation: The 4 numeric algorithms (accumulate and consorts) as well
as transform would allow a certain category of side effects.  The
numeric algorithms specify that they invoke the functor &quot;for
every iterator i in the range [first, last) in order&quot;. transform,
in contrast, would not give any guarantee regarding order of
invocation of the functor, which means that the functor can be invoked
in any arbitrary order.
</p>

<p>Why would that be a problem?  Consider an example: say the
transformator that is a simple enumerator ( or more generally
speaking, &quot;is order-sensitive&quot; ).  Since a standard
compliant implementation of transform is free to invoke the enumerator
in no definite order, the result could be a garbled enumeration.
Strictly speaking this is not a problem, but it is certainly at odds
with the prevalent understanding of transform as an algorithms that
assigns &quot;a new _corresponding_ value&quot; to the output
elements.
</p>

<p>All implementations that I know of invoke the transformator in
definite order, namely starting from first and proceeding to last -
1. Unless there is an optimization conceivable that takes advantage of
the indefinite order I would suggest to specify the order, because it
eliminate the uncertainty that users would otherwise have regarding
the order of execution of their potentially order-sensitive function
objects.
</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>In section 25.2.3 - Transform [lib.alg.transform] change:</p>
<blockquote><p>
-1- Effects: Assigns through every iterator i in the range [result,
result + (last1 - first1)) a new corresponding
value equal to op(*(first1 + (i - result)) or binary_op(*(first1 +
(i - result), *(first2 + (i - result))).
</p></blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote><p>
-1- Effects: Computes values by  invoking the operation op or binary_op 
for every iterator in the range [first1, last1) in order. Assigns through
every iterator i in the range [result, result + (last1 - first1)) a new
corresponding
value equal to op(*(first1 + (i - result)) or binary_op(*(first1 +
(i - result), *(first2 + (i - result))).
</p></blockquote>


<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>For Input Iterators an order is already guaranteed, because
only one order is possible.  If a user who passes a Forward
Iterator to one of these algorithms really needs a specific
order of execution, it's possible to achieve that effect by
wrapping it in an Input Iterator adaptor.</p>
