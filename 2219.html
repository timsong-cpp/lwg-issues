<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
The standard currently requires this to be invalid:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;functional&gt;

struct X { int i; } x;
auto f = &amp;X::i;
auto t1 = std::ref(x);
int i = std::mem_fn(f)(t1);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The call expression on the last line is equivalent to <tt><i>INVOKE</i>(f, std::ref(x))</tt> 
which according to 20.14.2 [func.require]p1 results in the invalid expression <tt>(*t1).*f</tt> 
because <tt>reference_wrapper&lt;X&gt;</tt> is neither an object of type <tt>X</tt> nor a reference 
to an object of type <tt>X</tt> nor a reference to an object of a type derived from <tt>X</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The same argument applies to pointers to member functions, and if they don't work with <tt>INVOKE</tt> 
it becomes harder to do all sorts of things such as:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<tt>call_once(o, &amp;std::thread::join, std::ref(thr))</tt>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
or
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<tt>async(&amp;std::list&lt;int&gt;::sort, std::ref(list));</tt>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The definition of <tt><i>INVOKE</i></tt> should be extended to handle reference wrappers.
</p>

<p><i>[2013-03-15 Issues Teleconference]</i></p>

<p>
Moved to Review.
</p>
<p>
The wording seems accurate, but verbose.  If possible, we would like to define the kind of thing being
specified so carefully as one of a number of potential language constructs in a single place.  It is
also possible that this clause <i>is</i> that single place.

<p>Jonathan comments:</p>

<p>In the proposed resolution in the first bullet <tt>(t1.*f)</tt> is not valid if <tt>t1</tt> is a
<tt>reference_wrapper</tt>, so we probably need a separate bullet to handle the
<tt>reference_wrapper</tt> case.</p>

<p><i>[2014-10-01, STL adds discussion and provides an improved resolution]</i></p>

<p>
Because neither <tt>t1.*f</tt> nor <tt>(*t1).*f</tt> will compile when <tt>t1</tt> is <tt>reference_wrapper&lt;U&gt;</tt> 
for any <tt>U</tt>, we don't need to inspect <tt>U</tt> carefully. We can bluntly detect all <tt>reference_wrapper</tt>s 
and use <tt>get()</tt> for them.
<p/>
We would have to be more careful if we had to deal with pointers to members of <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> itself.  
Fortunately, we don't. First, it doesn't have user-visible data members. Second, users technically can't take the 
addresses of its member functions (this is a consequence of 17.6.5.5 [member.functions], the Implementer's Best Friend).
<p/>
While we're in the neighborhood, I recommend simplifying and clarifying the wording used to detect base/derived objects.

<p><i>[2015-05, Lenexa]</i></p>

<p>
STL: latest note from Cologne, waiting for implementation experience<br/>
STL: don't think this is harder than anything else we do<br/>
MC: it does involve <tt>mem_fn</tt> and invoke<br/>
STL: my simplication was not to attempt fine-grained<br/>
STL: can ignore pmf<br/>
STL: can't invoke pmf to reference wrapper<br/>
STL: wording dated back to TR1 when there was no <tt>decltype</tt><br/>
MC: should <tt>decay_t&lt;decltype(t1)&gt;</tt> be pulled out since it is in multiple places<br/>
STL: it could be handled editorially<br/>
STL: we fix function, bind, invoke<br/>
STL: have not implemented this but believe it is fine<br/>
MC: Eric F, you have worked in invoke<br/>
EF: yes, looks ok<br/>
MC: consensus move to ready
