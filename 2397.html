<p>
Please consider the following example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;map&gt;
#include &lt;atomic&gt;

int main()
{
   std::map&lt;int, std::atomic&lt;int&gt;&gt; map_;

   map_.emplace(1, 0);  // <span style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bold">fail</span>
   map_.emplace(1);     // <span style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bold">fail</span>
   map_.emplace(1, {}); // <span style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bold">fail</span>

   map_.emplace(std::piecewise_construct,
       std::tuple&lt;int&gt;(1), std::tuple&lt;>()); // <span style="color:#006600;font-weight:bold">OK</span>
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The first three calls represent attempts by an ordinary programmer (in which role I appear today) to construct 
a map element. Since <tt>std::atomic&lt;int&gt;</tt> is non-copyable and immovable, I was naturally drawn to 
<tt>emplace()</tt> because it constructs in-place and hence doesn't need to copy or move. The logic behind the 
attempts was that <tt>K=int</tt> would be constructed from '<tt>1</tt>', and <tt>V=std::atomic&lt;int&gt;</tt> would be 
(directly) constructed by '<tt>0</tt>', default constructed, or constructed by '<tt>{}</tt>'.
<p/>
Yet none of the obvious attempts worked.
<p/>
I submit that at least two of the three ought to have worked, and that we have therefore a defect in either 
<tt>map::emplace</tt> or <tt>pair</tt>.

There exists a related <a href="http://cplusplus.github.io/EWG/ewg-toc.html#114">EWG issue</a> for this.

<p/>
If the proposal N4387 would be accepted, it would solve the first problem mentioned above.

<p>
AM: I think Peter's expectation is misguided that the second and third "//fail" cases should work.<br/> 
DK: Howard's paper [note: which hasn't been written yet] will make the second case work... AM: ...but 
the third one will never work without core changes.
<p/>
Case 1 is solved by DK's paper, cases 2 and 3 are not defects; at best they are extensions. 
</p>

<p><i>[2015-05, Lenexa]</i></p>

<p>
STL: think this is covered with N4387<br/>
MC: this was accepted in Cologne<br/>
STL: only want to fix the first emplace<br/>
MC: leave alone and mark as closed by N4387<br/>
</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
Resolved by acceptance of <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4387.html">N4387</a>.
