<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>Paragraph 1 of 27.6.1.2.1 contains general requirements for all
formatted input functions. Some of the functions defined in section
27.6.1.2 explicitly say that those requirements apply (&quot;Behaves
like a formatted input member (as described in 27.6.1.2.1)&quot;), but
others don't. The question: is 27.6.1.2.1 supposed to apply to
everything in 27.6.1.2, or only to those member functions that
explicitly say &quot;behaves like a formatted input member&quot;? Or
to put it differently: are we to assume that everything that appears
in a section called &quot;Formatted input functions&quot; really is a
formatted input function? I assume that 27.6.1.2.1 is intended to
apply to the arithmetic extractors (27.6.1.2.2), but I assume that it
is not intended to apply to extractors like </p>

<pre>    basic_istream&amp; operator&gt;&gt;(basic_istream&amp; (*pf)(basic_istream&amp;));</pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre>    basic_istream&amp; operator&gt;&gt;(basic_streammbuf*);</pre>

<p>There is a similar ambiguity for unformatted input, formatted output, and unformatted
output. </p>

<p>Comments from Judy Ward: It seems like the problem is that the
basic_istream and basic_ostream operator &lt;&lt;()'s that are used
for the manipulators and streambuf* are in the wrong section and
should have their own separate section or be modified to make it clear
that the &quot;Common requirements&quot; listed in section 27.6.1.2.1
(for basic_istream) and section 27.6.2.5.1 (for basic_ostream) do not
apply to them. </p>

<p>Additional comments from Dietmar K&uuml;hl: It appears to be somewhat
nonsensical to consider the functions defined in  [istream::extractors] paragraphs 1 to 5 to be &quot;Formatted input
function&quot; but since these functions are defined in a section
labeled &quot;Formatted input functions&quot; it is unclear to me
whether these operators are considered formatted input functions which
have to conform to the &quot;common requirements&quot; from 27.7.4.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/istream.formatted.reqmts">[istream.formatted.reqmts]</a>: If this is the case, all manipulators, not
just <tt>ws</tt>, would skip whitespace unless <tt>noskipws</tt> is
set (... but setting <tt>noskipws</tt> using the manipulator syntax
would also skip whitespace :-)</p> <p>It is not clear which functions
are to be considered unformatted input functions. As written, it seems
that all functions in 27.7.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/istream.unformatted">[istream.unformatted]</a> are unformatted input
functions. However, it does not really make much sense to construct a
sentry object for <tt>gcount()</tt>, <tt>sync()</tt>, ... Also it is
unclear what happens to the <tt>gcount()</tt> if
eg. <tt>gcount()</tt>, <tt>putback()</tt>, <tt>unget()</tt>, or
<tt>sync()</tt> is called: These functions don't extract characters,
some of them even &quot;unextract&quot; a character. Should this still
be reflected in <tt>gcount()</tt>? Of course, it could be read as if
after a call to <tt>gcount()</tt> <tt>gcount()</tt> return <tt>0</tt>
(the last unformatted input function, <tt>gcount()</tt>, didn't
extract any character) and after a call to <tt>putback()</tt>
<tt>gcount()</tt> returns <tt>-1</tt> (the last unformatted input
function <tt>putback()</tt> did &quot;extract&quot; back into the
stream). Correspondingly for <tt>unget()</tt>. Is this what is
intended?  If so, this should be clarified. Otherwise, a corresponding
clarification should be used.</p>
