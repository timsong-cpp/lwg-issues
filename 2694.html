<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
[locale.facet]/1 (then-called [lib.locale.facet]) read in C++03:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Class <tt>facet</tt> is the base class for locale feature sets. A class is a <i>facet</i> if it is publicly derived 
from another facet, or if it is a class derived from <tt>locale::facet</tt> and containing a publicly-accessible 
declaration as follows: [<i>Footnote</i>: This is a complete list of requirements; there are no other requirements. 
Thus, a facet class need not have a public copy constructor, assignment, default constructor, destructor, etc.]
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
static ::std::locale::id id;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Template parameters in this clause which are required to be facets are those named <tt>Facet</tt> in declarations. 
A program that passes a type that is <em>not</em> a facet, as an (explicit or deduced) template parameter to a locale 
function expecting a facet, is ill-formed.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
LWG <a href="436">436</a>'s intent appears to be to ban <tt>volatile</tt>-qualified facets and permitting 
<tt>const</tt>-qualified ones. The PR was somewhat poorly worded, however, and the editor in applying 
it deleted the whole first half of the paragraph, including the definition of <i>facet</i> and the requirement 
for a static data member named <tt>id</tt>.
<p/>
As a result, we have things like 28.3.1.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/locale.id">[locale.id]</a>/2 and 28.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/locale.global.templates">[locale.global.templates]</a>/1 referring 
to the <tt>id</tt> member that's not defined anywhere in the working draft.
</p>

<p><i>[2016-08-03 Chicago]</i></p>

<p>Fri AM: Moved to Tentatively Ready</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
This wording is relative to N4582.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Insert the following paragraph before 28.3.1.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/locale.facet">[locale.facet]</a>/1:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<ins>-?- Class <tt>facet</tt> is the base class for locale feature sets. A class is a <i>facet</i> if it is publicly 
derived from another facet, or if it is a class derived from <tt>locale::facet</tt> and containing a publicly accessible 
declaration as follows: [<i>Footnote</i>: This is a complete list of requirements; there are no other requirements. Thus, a 
facet class need not have a public copy constructor, assignment, default constructor, destructor, etc.]</ins>
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<ins>static ::std::locale::id id;</ins>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
-1- Template parameters in this Clause which are required to be facets are those named <tt>Facet</tt> in declarations. A
program that passes a type that is <i>not</i> a facet, or a type that refers to a volatile-qualified facet, as an (explicit
or deduced) template parameter to a locale function expecting a facet, is ill-formed. A const-qualified facet is
a valid template argument to any locale function that expects a Facet template parameter.
