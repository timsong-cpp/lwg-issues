<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>Table 72 in 22.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/input.iterators">[input.iterators]</a> specifies semantics for
<tt>*r++</tt> of:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>{ T tmp = *r; ++r; return tmp; }</tt></p>

<p>There are two problems with this.  First, the return type is
specified to be "T", as opposed to something like "convertible to T".
This is too specific: we want to allow *r++ to return an lvalue.</p>

<p>Second, writing the semantics in terms of code misleadingly
suggests that the effects *r++ should precisely replicate the behavior
of this code, including side effects.  (Does this mean that *r++
should invoke the copy constructor exactly as many times as the sample
code above would?) See issue <a href="334">334</a> for a similar
problem.</p>



<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>In Table 72 in 22.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/input.iterators">[input.iterators]</a>, change the return type
for <tt>*r++</tt> from <tt>T</tt> to "convertible to T".</p>


<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>This issue has two parts: the return type, and the number of times
  the copy constructor is invoked.</p>

<p>The LWG believes the the first part is a real issue.  It's
  inappropriate for the return type to be specified so much more
  precisely for *r++ than it is for *r.  In particular, if r is of
  (say) type <tt>int*</tt>, then *r++ isn't <tt>int</tt>,
  but <tt>int&amp;</tt>.</p>

<p>The LWG does not believe that the number of times the copy
  constructor is invoked is a real issue.  This can vary in any case,
  because of language rules on copy constructor elision.  That's too
  much to read into these semantics clauses.</p>

<p>Additionally, as Dave Abrahams pointed out (c++std-lib-13703): since 
   we're told (24.1/3) that forward iterators satisfy all the requirements
   of input iterators, we can't impose any requirements in the Input
   Iterator requirements table that forward iterators don't satisfy.</p>
