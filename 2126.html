<p>
 30.4.1.2.1 [thread.mutex.class]&#47;3 says that the class mutex "shall satisfy all the <tt>Mutex</tt> requirements (30.4.1 [thread.mutex.requirements])". 
 30.4.1.2.1 [thread.mutex.class] is part of 30.4.1 [thread.mutex.requirements], so at the very least, this 
 requirement is recursive. But worse, there is nothing that says what "the <tt>Mutex</tt> requirements" refers to. For example, 
 the "<tt>Lockable</tt> requirements" section starts with "A type <tt>L</tt> meets the <tt>Lockable</tt> requirements if &hellip;". There is no such 
 statement for "the <tt>Mutex</tt> requirements".
<p/>
Organizationally, paragraphs 1-26 in 30.4.1.2 [thread.mutex.requirements.mutex] should probably be in a subclause with a name. 
(This is actually an ISO requirement, to avoid exactly this kind of ambiguous referencing) Then the first sentence of 
30.4.1.2.1 [thread.mutex.class]&#47;3 can become a note: "The class mutex meets the requirements of (whatever)", since that 
subclause already says that the mutex types "shall meet the requirements set out in this section."
<p/>
And similarly for 30.4.1.2.2 [thread.mutex.recursive]&#47;2 (<tt>recursive_mutex</tt>).
<p/>
30.4.1.3 [thread.timedmutex.requirements], Timed mutex types, also needs the same rearrangement: its introductory 
requirements should be moved into a subclause, and the first sentences of 30.4.1.3.1 [thread.timedmutex.class]&#47;2 
and 30.4.1.3.2 [thread.timedmutex.recursive]&#47;2 should be turned into notes that refer to this new subclause and 
to the new subclause in 30.4.1.2 [thread.mutex.requirements.mutex].

<p>
Seems no real ambiguity. May need some reorg of text rather then changing the wording.
</p>
<p>
Is there much that needs to be changed? But Pete's suggestion of putting requirement in separate sub section is good.
Should be the direction to editor.
</p>
<p>
Suggest this is an editorial change. Happy with Pete's comments.
