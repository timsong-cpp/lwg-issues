<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
The <tt>RandomNumberEngineAdaptor</tt> concept breaks precedent in the
way the library has been specified by grouping requirements into a
concept that is never actually used in the library.
</p>
<p>
This is undoubtedly a very helpful device for documentation, but we are not
comfortable with the precedent - especially as we have rejected national
body comments on the same grounds.
</p>
<p>
Suggest either removing the concept, or providing an algorithm/type that
requires this concept in their definition (such as a factory function to
create new engines).
</p>
<p>
The preference is to create a single new algorithm and retain the value of
the existing documentation.
</p>

<p><i>[
Batavia (2009-05):
]</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Walter points out that it is unlikely that any algorithm would ever
require this concept, but that the concept nonetheless is useful as
documentation, and (via concept maps) as a means of checking specific adapters.
</p>
<p>
Alisdair disagrees as to the concept's value as documentation.
</p>
<p>
Marc points out that the <tt>RandomNumberDistribution</tt>
is also a concept not used elsewhere in the Standard.
</p>
<p>
Pete agrees that a policy of not inventing concepts
that aren't used in the Standard is a good starting point,
but should not be used as a criterion for rejecting a concept.
</p>
<p>
Move to Open.
