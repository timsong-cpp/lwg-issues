<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Section 25.8.3.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/equal.range">[equal.range]</a>
states that at most 2 * log(last - first) + 1
comparisons are allowed for equal_range.
</p>

<p>It is not possible to implement equal_range with these constraints.</p>

<p>In a range of one element as in:</p>
<pre>
    int x = 1;
    equal_range(&amp;x, &amp;x + 1, 1)
</pre>

<p>it is easy to see that at least 2 comparison operations are needed.</p>

<p>For this case at most 2 * log(1) + 1 = 1 comparison is allowed.</p>

<p>I have checked a few libraries and they all use the same (nonconforming)
algorithm for equal_range that has a complexity of</p>
<pre>
     2* log(distance(first, last)) + 2.
</pre>
<p>I guess this is the algorithm that the standard assumes for equal_range.</p>

<p>
It is easy to see that 2 * log(distance) + 2 comparisons are enough
since equal range can be implemented with lower_bound and upper_bound
(both log(distance) + 1).
</p>

<p>
I think it is better to require something like 2log(distance) + O(1)  (or
even logarithmic as multiset::equal_range).
Then an implementation has more room to optimize for certain cases (e.g.
have log(distance) characteristics when at most match is found in the range
but 2log(distance) + 4 for the worst case).
</p>



<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>In 25.8.3.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/lower.bound">[lower.bound]</a>/4, change <tt>log(last - first) + 1</tt>
to <tt>log<sub>2</sub>(last - first) + <i>O</i>(1)</tt>.</p>

<p>In 25.8.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/upper.bound">[upper.bound]</a>/4, change <tt>log(last - first) + 1</tt>
to <tt>log<sub>2</sub>(last - first) + <i>O</i>(1)</tt>.</p>

<p>In 25.8.3.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/equal.range">[equal.range]</a>/4, change <tt>2*log(last - first) + 1</tt>
to <tt>2*log<sub>2</sub>(last - first) + <i>O</i>(1)</tt>.</p>

<p><i>[Matt provided wording]</i></p>



<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>The LWG considered just saying <i>O</i>(log n) for all three, but
  decided that threw away too much valuable information.  The fact
  that lower_bound is twice as fast as equal_range is important.
  However, it's better to allow an arbitrary additive constant than to
  specify an exact count.  An exact count would have to
  involve <tt>floor</tt> or <tt>ceil</tt>.  It would be too easy to
  get this wrong, and don't provide any substantial value for users.</p>
