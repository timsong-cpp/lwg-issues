According to 99 [atomics.types.operations.req] p4,
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
A ::A () noexcept = default;
</pre><blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects:</i> leaves the atomic object in an uninitialized state. [<i>Note:</i> These semantics ensure compatibility
with <tt>C</tt>. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
This implementation requirement is OK for POD types, like <tt>int</tt>, but 31.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.types.generic">[atomics.types.generic]</a> p1
intentionally allows template arguments of <tt>atomic</tt> with a non-trivial default constructor ("The type of the template argument
<tt>T</tt> shall be trivially copyable (3.9)"), so this wording can be read in a way that makes the behaviour of the following code
undefined:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;atomic&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct S {
  S() noexcept : v(42) {}
  int v;
};

int main() {
  std::atomic&lt;S&gt; as; // Default-initialization
  std::cout &lt;&lt; as.load().v &lt;&lt; std::endl; // ?
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
For a user-defined emulation of <tt>atomic</tt> the expected outcome would be defined and the program would output "42",
but existing implementations differ and the result value is a "random number" for at least one implementation. This seems
very surprising to me.
<p/>
To realize that seemingly existing requirement, an implementation is either required to violate normal language rules internally
or to perform specific bit-randomization-techniques after the normal default-initialization that called the default constructor
of <tt>S</tt>.
<p/>
According to my understanding, the non-normative note in 99 [atomics.types.operations.req] p4 is intended to
refer to types that are valid <tt>C</tt>-types, but the example type <tt>S</tt> is not such a type.
<p/>
To make the mental model of <tt>atomic</tt>'s default constructor more intuitive for user-code, I suggest to clarify the wording
to have the effects of default-initialization instead. The current state seems more like an unintended effect of imprecise
language used here and has some similarities to wording that was incorrectly used to specify <tt>atomic_flag</tt> initialization
as described by LWG <a href="2159">2159</a>.
</p>

<p><i>[2014-05-17, Daniel comments and provides alternative wording]</i></p>


<p>
The current wording was considered controversial as expressed by reflector discussions. To me, the actual problem is not newly
introduced by that wording, but instead is already present in basically all paragraphs specifying semantics of atomic types,
since the wording never clearly distinguishes the value of the actual atomic type <i>A</i> and the value of the "underlying",
corresponding non-atomic type <i>C</i>. The revised proposed wording attempts to improve the current ambiguity of these two
kinds of values.

<p>SG1 also reviewed another PR from Lawrence Crowl. Lawrence's feedback was that turning atomic&lt;T&gt; into a container of T was a mistake, even if we allow the implementation of atomic to contain a T. SG1 agreed with Lawrence, but his PR (<a href="http://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21toronto2017/DefaultInitNonContainer">http://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21toronto2017/DefaultInitNonContainer</a>) had massive merge conflicts caused by the adoption of P0558. Billy O'Neal supplied a new PR, which SG1 agreed to and which LWG looked at informally. This change also makes it clearer that initialization of an atomic is not an atomic operation in all forms, changes the C compatibility example to actually be compatible with C, and removes "initialization-compatible" which is not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>SG1 considered moving <tt>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</tt> into Annex D, as their understanding at this time is that WG14 is considering removal of that macro. However, consensus was that moving things between clauses would require a paper, and that we should wait to remove that until WG14 actually does so.</p>

<p><i>[2019-02, Monday in Kona]</i></p>

<p>While discussing Richard's P1286 paper, we noted that this issue's resolution needs to be updated based on that discussion.</p>
<p>Also, the idea that <code>atomic() noexcept = default</code> is ok will not fly for implementors who store additional information inside the atomic variable.</p>
