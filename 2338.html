<p>
28.7 [re.traits]/7, begins with "if <tt>typeid(use_facet&lt;collate&lt;charT&gt; &gt;) == typeid(collate_byname&lt;charT&gt;)</tt>", 
which appears to be pseudocode with the intention to convey that the collate facet has not been replaced by the user. Cf. the wording in 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2003/n1429.htm">N1429</a> "there is no portable way to implement 
<tt>transform_primary</tt> in terms of <tt>std::locale</tt>, since even if the sort key format returned by 
<tt>std::collate_byname&lt;&gt;::transform</tt> is known and can be converted into a primary sort key, the user can still 
install their own custom <tt>std::collate</tt> implementation into the locale object used, and that can use any sort key 
format they see fit.".
<p/>
Taken literally, 28.7 [re.traits]/7 appears to imply that named locales are required to hold their collate facets with 
dynamic type <tt>std::collate_byname&lt;charT&gt;</tt>, which is in fact true in some implementations (e.g libc++), but not others 
(e.g. libstdc++). This does not follow from the description of <tt>_byname</tt> in 22.3.1.1.2 [locale.facet]/4, which is only 
required to provide equivalent semantics, to the named locale's facet, not to actually be one.

<p><i>[2015-05-06 Lenexa: Move to Open]</i></p>


<p>MC, RP: Consequence of failing to follow the rule is UB.</p>
<p>MC: Tightening of requirements.</p>
<p>RP: It should be this way, we just didn't impose it before.</p>
<p>MC: Second change is a bug fix, original code didn't work.</p>
<p>TK: Doesn't seem to make things worse.</p>
<p>Bring up in larger group tomorrow.</p>
<p>JW arrives.</p>
<p>JW: libstdc++ violates this due to two std::string ABIs.</p>
<p>JW: This prevents installing a type derived from Facet_byname, constrains the implementor from using a smarter derived class version.</p>
<p>JW: Can't look at facet id to detect replacement, because replacements have the same id.</p>
<p>RP: Can you give it multiple ids through multiple inheritance?</p>
<p>JW: No, the facet mechanism wouldn't like that.</p>
<p>JW: We should also ask Martin Sebor, he's implemented this stuff recently.</p>
<p>MC: Sounds like this resolution doesn't work, need a better solution.</p>
<p>JW: Write in words "if the facet has not been replaced by the user", the implementation knows how to detect that, but not like this.</p>
<p>RP: User RE traits need to detect this too.</p>
<p>JW: =(</p>
<p>Move to Open, JW will invite Martin Sebor to join LWG for discussion.</p>
<p>Later ... </p>
<p>JW: This is not needed for user specializations after all.</p>
<p>MC: Agree, [re.traits]/7 only applies to the stdlib traits.</p>
<p>NM: Effects: doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>JW, NM, Martin Sebor to come up with new wording.</p>



<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>This wording is relative to N3691.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify 22.3.1.1.2 [locale.facet]/4 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><p>
For some standard facets a standard "...<tt>_byname</tt>" class, derived from it, implements the virtual function
semantics <del>equivalent to</del><ins>provided by</ins> that facet of the locale constructed by <tt>locale(const char*)</tt> 
with the same name.
Each such facet provides a constructor that takes a <tt>const char*</tt> argument, which names the locale, and a
<tt>refs</tt> argument, which is passed to the base class constructor. Each such facet also provides a constructor
that takes a string argument <tt>str</tt> and a <tt>refs</tt> argument, which has the same effect as calling the first
constructor with the two arguments <tt>str.c_str()</tt> and <tt>refs</tt>. If there is no "...<tt>_byname</tt>" 
version of a facet, the base class implements named locale semantics itself by reference to other facets. <ins>For any 
locale <tt>loc</tt> constructed by <tt>locale(const char*)</tt> and facet <tt>Facet</tt> that has a corresponding standard 
<tt>Facet_byname</tt> class, <tt>typeid(use_facet&lt;Facet&gt;(loc)) == typeid(Facet_byname)</tt>.</ins>
</p></blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>Modify 28.7 [re.traits]/7 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class ForwardIterator&gt;
  string_type transform_primary(ForwardIterator first, ForwardIterator last) const;
</pre><blockquote>
<p>
-7- <i>Effects:</i> if <tt>typeid(use_facet&lt;collate&lt;charT&gt; &gt;<ins>(getloc())</ins>) == typeid(collate_byname&lt;charT&gt;)</tt> 
and the form of the sort key returned by <tt>collate_byname&lt;charT&gt;::transform(first, last)</tt> is known and
can be converted into a primary sort key then returns that key, otherwise returns an empty string.
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
</li>
