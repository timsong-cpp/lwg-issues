<p>
All the random number engine types in this clause have a
constructor taking an unsigned integer type, and a
constructor template for seed sequences. This means that
an attempt to create a random number engine seeded by
an integer literal must remember to add the appropriate
unsigned suffix to the literal, as a signed integer will
attempt to use the seed sequence template, yielding
undefined behaviour, as per 26.5.1.1p1a. It would be
helpful if at least these anticipated cases produced a
defined behaviour, either an erroneous program with
diagnostic, or a conversion to unsigned int forwarding to
the appropriate constructor.

<p>
I suggest to apply a similar solution as recently suggested for <a href="1234">1234</a>.
It is basically a requirement for an implementation to constrain the template.
</p>

<p><i>[
2010-11-04 Howard suggests to use <tt>!is_convertible&lt;Sseq, result_type&gt;::value</tt>
as minimum requirement instead of the originally proposed <tt>!is_scalar&lt;Sseq&gt;::value</tt>.
This would allow for a user-defined type <tt>BigNum</tt>, that is convertible to <tt>result_type</tt>,
to be used as argument for a seed instead of a seed sequence. The wording has been updated to 
reflect this suggestion.

<p><i>[
2010 Batavia: There were some initial concerns regarding the portability and reproducibility of results 
when seeded with a negative signed value, but these concerns were allayed after discussion. Thus, after
reviewing the issue, the working group concurred with the issue's Proposed Resolution.

<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
Add the following paragraph at the end of 26.6.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.eng">[rand.eng]</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
5 Each template specified in this section [rand.eng] requires one or more relationships, involving the value(s) of
its non-type template parameter(s), to hold. A program instantiating any of these templates is ill-formed if
any such required relationship fails to hold.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
<ins>? For every random number engine and for every random number engine adaptor <tt>X</tt> defined in this sub-clause 
[rand.eng] and in sub-clause [rand.adapt]:</ins></p>
<ul>
<li><ins>If the constructor</ins>
<blockquote><pre>
<ins>template&lt;class Sseq&gt; explicit X(Sseq&amp; q);</ins>
</pre></blockquote><p>
<ins>is called with a type <tt>Sseq</tt> that does not qualify as a seed sequence, then this constructor 
shall not participate in overload resolution.
</ins></p>
</li>
<li><ins>If the member function</ins>
<blockquote><pre>
<ins>template&lt;class Sseq&gt; void seed(Sseq&amp; q);</ins>
</pre></blockquote><p>
<ins>is called with a type <tt>Sseq</tt> that does not qualify as a seed sequence, then this function 
shall not participate in overload resolution.
</ins></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ins>The extent to which an implementation determines that a type cannot be a seed sequence is unspecified,
except that as a minimum a type shall not qualify as seed sequence, if it is implicitly convertible
to <tt>X::result_type</tt>.</ins>
</p>
