<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
this DR follows the discussion on the previous thread "codecvt::do_in
not consuming external characters". It's just a clarification issue
and not a request for a change.
</p>
<p>
Can do_in()/do_out() produce output characters without consuming input 
characters as a result of operation on state?
</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
Add a note at the end of 22.4.1.4.2 [locale.codecvt.virtuals], 
paragraph 3:
</p>

<p>
[Note: As a result of operations on state, it can return ok or partial 
and set from_next == from and to_next != to. --end note]
</p>


<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>
The submitter believes that standard already provides an affirmative
answer to the question. However, the current wording has induced a few
library implementors to make the incorrect assumption that
do_in()/do_out() always consume at least one internal character when
they succeed.
</p>

<p>
The submitter also believes that the proposed resolution is not in
conflict with the related issue 76. Moreover, by explicitly allowing
operations on state to produce characters, a codecvt implementation
may effectively implement N-to-M translations without violating the
"one character at a time" principle described in such issue. On a side
note, the footnote in the proposed resolution of issue 76 that
informally rules out N-to-M translations for basic_filebuf should be
removed if this issue is accepted as valid.
</p>


<p><i>[
Kona (2007): The proposed resolution is to add a note. Since this is
non-normative, the issue is editorial, but we believe that the note is
correct. Proposed Disposition: NAD, Editorial
]</i></p>
