<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>Currently the following will not compile on two well-known standard
library implementations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>#include &lt;set&gt;
using namespace std;

void f(const set&lt;int&gt; &amp;s)
{
  set&lt;int&gt;::iterator i;
  if (i==s.end()); // s.end() returns a const_iterator
}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The reason this doesn't compile is because operator== was implemented
as a member function of the nested classes set:iterator and
set::const_iterator, and there is no conversion from const_iterator to
iterator. Surprisingly, (s.end() == i) does work, though, because of
the conversion from iterator to const_iterator.
</p>

<p>
I don't see a requirement anywhere in the standard that this must
work. Should there be one?  If so, I think the requirement would need
to be added to the tables in section 24.1.1. I'm not sure about the
wording.  If this requirement existed in the standard, I would think
that implementors would have to make the comparison operators
non-member functions.</p>

<p>This issues was also raised on comp.std.c++ by Darin
Adler.&nbsp; The example given was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>bool check_equal(std::deque&lt;int&gt;::iterator i,
std::deque&lt;int&gt;::const_iterator ci)
{
return i == ci;
}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Comment from John Potter:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
    In case nobody has noticed, accepting it will break reverse_iterator.
    </p>

    <p>
    The fix is to make the comparison operators templated on two types.
    </p>

    <pre>
    template &lt;class Iterator1, class Iterator2&gt;
    bool operator== (reverse_iterator&lt;Iterator1&gt; const&amp; x,
                     reverse_iterator&lt;Iterator2&gt; const&amp; y);
    </pre>

    <p>
    Obviously:  return x.base() == y.base();
    </p>

    <p>
    Currently, no reverse_iterator to const_reverse_iterator compares are
    valid.
    </p>

    <p>
    BTW, I think the issue is in support of bad code.  Compares should be
    between two iterators of the same type.  All std::algorithms require
    the begin and end iterators to be of the same type. 
    </p>

<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>Insert this paragraph after 21.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements">[container.requirements]</a> paragraph 7:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the expressions</p>
  <pre>
    i == j
    i != j
    i &lt; j
    i &lt;= j
    i &gt;= j
    i &gt; j
    i - j
  </pre>
  <p>Where i and j denote objects of a container's iterator type,
  either or both may be replaced by an object of the container's
  const_iterator type referring to the same element with no
  change in semantics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>[post-Toronto: Judy supplied a proposed resolution saying that
<tt>iterator</tt> and <tt>const_iterator</tt> could be freely mixed in
iterator comparison and difference operations.]</i></p>


<p><i>[Redmond: Dave and Howard supplied a new proposed resolution which
explicitly listed expressions; there was concern that the previous
proposed resolution was too informal.]</i></p>



<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>
The LWG believes it is clear that the above wording applies only to
the nested types <tt>X::iterator</tt> and <tt>X::const_iterator</tt>,
where <tt>X</tt> is a container.  There is no requirement that
<tt>X::reverse_iterator</tt> and <tt>X::const_reverse_iterator</tt>
can be mixed.  If mixing them is considered important, that's a
separate issue.  (Issue <a href="280">280</a>.)
