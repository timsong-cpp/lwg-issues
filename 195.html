<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>Suppose that <tt>is.flags() &amp; ios_base::skipws</tt> is nonzero.
What should <tt>basic_istream&lt;&gt;::sentry</tt>'s constructor do if it
reaches eof while skipping whitespace?  27.6.1.1.2/5 suggests it
should set failbit. Should it set eofbit as well?  The standard
doesn't seem to answer that question.</p>

<p>On the one hand, nothing in 27.7.2.1.3 [istream::sentry] says that
<tt>basic_istream&lt;&gt;::sentry</tt> should ever set eofbit.  On the
other hand, 27.7.2.1 [istream] paragraph 4 says that if
extraction from a <tt>streambuf</tt> &quot;returns
<tt>traits::eof()</tt>, then the input function, except as explicitly
noted otherwise, completes its actions and does
<tt>setstate(eofbit)&quot;</tt>.  So the question comes down to
whether <tt>basic_istream&lt;&gt;::sentry</tt>'s constructor is an
input function.</p>

<p>Comments from Jerry Schwarz:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was always my intention that eofbit should be set any time that a
virtual returned something to indicate eof, no matter what reason
iostream code had for calling the virtual.</p>
<p>
The motivation for this is that I did not want to require streambufs
to behave consistently if their virtuals are called after they have
signaled eof.</p>
<p>
The classic case is a streambuf reading from a UNIX file.  EOF isn't
really a state for UNIX file descriptors.  The convention is that a
read on UNIX returns 0 bytes to indicate &quot;EOF&quot;, but the file
descriptor isn't shut down in any way and future reads do not
necessarily also return 0 bytes.  In particular, you can read from
tty's on UNIX even after they have signaled &quot;EOF&quot;.  (It
isn't always understood that a ^D on UNIX is not an EOF indicator, but
an EOL indicator.  By typing a &quot;line&quot; consisting solely of
^D you cause a read to return 0 bytes, and by convention this is
interpreted as end of file.)</p>
</blockquote>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>Add a sentence to the end of 27.6.1.1.2 paragraph 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <tt>is.rdbuf()-&gt;sbumpc()</tt> or <tt>is.rdbuf()-&gt;sgetc()</tt>
returns <tt>traits::eof()</tt>, the function calls
<tt>setstate(failbit | eofbit)</tt> (which may throw
<tt>ios_base::failure</tt>).
</p>
