<p>
The seemingly non-normative (?) paragraph 61 (referring to N3936) describing how "most machines" define 
<tt>std::numeric_limits&lt;T&gt;::is_modulo</tt> in [numeric.limits.members] appears to have some issues, in my opinion.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
-61- On most machines, this is <tt>false</tt> for floating types, <tt>true</tt> for unsigned integers, and <tt>true</tt> 
for signed integers.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Issues I see:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Very minor: change clause 2 to "this is <tt>false</tt> for floating <ins>point</ins> types". Other uses of the term 
say "floating point types" rather than just "floating types" &mdash; see nearby <tt>is_iec559</tt>, <tt>tinyness_before</tt>, 
etc.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>is_modulo</tt> <em>must</em> be <tt>true</tt> for unsigned integers in order to be compliant with the Standard; 
this is not just for "most machines". For reference, this requirement is from [basic.fundamental] paragraph 4 with its 
footnote 48.</p></li>
<li><p>Depending on the definition of "most machines", <tt>is_modulo</tt> could be <tt>false</tt> for most machines' signed 
integer types. GCC, Clang and Visual Studio, the 3 most popular C++ compilers by far, by default treat signed integer overflow 
as undefined.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
As an additional note regarding the definition of <tt>is_modulo</tt>, it seems like it should be explicitly mentioned that 
on an implementation for which signed integer overflow is undefined, <tt>is_modulo</tt> shall be <tt>false</tt> for signed 
integer types. It took bugs filed for all three of these compilers before they finally changed (or planned to change) 
<tt>is_modulo</tt> to <tt>false</tt> for signed types.
</p>

<p>
HH: agree with the proposal, don't like the phrasing<br/>
AM: second note feels a bit wooly<br/>
WB: not even happy with the first note, notes shouldn't say "shall"<br/>
JW: the original isn't very prescriptive because "on most machines" is not something the standard controls.<br/>
AM: "On most machines" should become a note too?<br/>
AM: first note is repeating something defined in core, shouldn't say it normatively here. Change "shall" to "is"?<br/>
MC: don't like "signed integer overflow is left undefined" ... it's just plain undefined.<br/>
AM: implementations can define what they do in that case and provide guarantees.<br/>
WB: in paragraph 61, would like to see "this" replaced by "is_modulo"<br/>
AM: Move to Open

<p><i>[2016-05-21 Melissa Mears comments and provides improved wording]</i></p>

<p>
GCC and Clang have <tt>-fwrapv</tt> and MSVC (as of a May 2016 preview build)
has <tt>/d2UndefIntOverflow-</tt> as compiler command line flags to define
signed integer overflow as wrapping.  Such implementations can't set
<tt>is_modulo</tt> to <tt>true</tt> for signed integer types when these options are
enabled, because if translation units using opposite settings were
linked together, the One Definition Rule would be violated.

<p><i>[2016-06, Oulu]</i></p>

<p>
We believe that the notes about unsigned integer types and floating point types are already evident from what
the standard describes and should be removed. Furthermore the suggested note for signed integer types really shouldn't refer to a
footnote in the own document, because footnotes have no stable identifiers. The below given revised resolution
has been changed accordingly.
</p>
<p><i>[2016-06 Oulu]</i></p>

<p>Added rationalization for changes. Moved to Ready.</p>
<p>Friday: status to Immediate</p>
