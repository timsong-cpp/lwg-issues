<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2775.htm">N2775</a>,
<i>Small library thread-safety revisions</i>, among other changes, removed a note from
17.6.4.10 [res.on.objects] that read:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>Note:</i> This prohibition against concurrent non-const access means that
modifying an object of a standard library type shared between threads
without using a locking mechanism may result in a data race. <i>--end note</i>.]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
That resulted in wording which is technically correct but can only be
understood by reading the lengthy and complex 17.6.5.9 [res.on.data.races]
Data race avoidance. This has the effect of making
17.6.4.10 [res.on.objects] unclear, and has already resulted in a query
to the LWG reflector. See c++std-lib-23194.

<blockquote>
<p>
The proposed wording seems to need a bit of tweaking
("really bad idea" isn't quite up to standardese).
We would like feedback
as to whether the original Note's removal was intentional.
</p>
<p>
Change the phrase "is a really bad idea"
to "risks undefined behavior" and
move to Review status.

Note: Change to read: "Modifying...", Delete 'thus', move to Ready
</p></blockquote>



<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
Change 17.6.4.10 [res.on.objects] as indicated:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The behavior of a program is undefined if calls to standard library
functions from different threads may introduce a data race. The
conditions under which this may occur are specified in 17.6.4.7.
</p>
<p><ins>
[<i>Note:</i> Modifying an object of a standard library type shared between
threads risks undefined behavior unless objects of the type are explicitly
specified as being sharable without data races or the user supplies a
locking mechanism. <i>--end note</i>]
</ins></p>
