<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
22.1.1, p7 (copied below) allows iostream formatters and extractors
to make assumptions about the values returned from facet members.
However, such assumptions are apparently not guaranteed to hold
in other cases (e.g., when the facet members are being called directly
rather than as a result of iostream calls, or between successive
calls to the same iostream functions with no interevening calls to
<tt>imbue()</tt>, or even when the facet member functions are called
from other member functions of other facets). This restriction
prevents locale from being implemented efficiently.
</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>Change the first sentence in 22.1.1, p7 from</p>
<blockquote><p>
    In successive calls to a locale facet member function during
    a call to an iostream inserter or extractor or a streambuf member
    function, the returned result shall be identical. [Note: This
    implies that such results may safely be reused without calling
    the locale facet member function again, and that member functions
    of iostream classes cannot safely call <tt>imbue()</tt>
    themselves, except as specified elsewhere. --end note]
</p></blockquote>

<p>to</p>

<blockquote><p>
    In successive calls to a locale facet member function on a facet
    object installed in the same locale, the returned result shall be
    identical. ...
</p></blockquote>



<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>This change is reasonable becuase it clarifies the intent of this
  part of the standard.</p>
