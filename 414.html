<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Consider the following code fragment:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
int A[8] = { 1,3,5,7,9,8,4,2 };
std::vector&lt;int&gt; v(A, A+8);

std::vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator i1 = v.begin() + 3;
std::vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator i2 = v.begin() + 4;
v.erase(i1);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Which iterators are invalidated by <code>v.erase(i1)</code>: i1, i2,
both, or neither?
</p>

<p>
On all existing implementations that I know of, the status of i1 and
i2 is the same: both of them will be iterators that point to some
elements of the vector (albeit not the same elements they did
before).  You won't get a crash if you use them.  Depending on 
exactly what you mean by "invalidate", you might say that neither one
has been invalidated because they still point to <i>something</i>,
or you might say that both have been invalidated because in both
cases the elements they point to have been changed out from under the
iterator.
</p>

<p>
The standard doesn't say either of those things.  It says that erase
invalidates all iterators and references "after the point of the
erase".  This doesn't include i1, since it's at the point of the
erase instead of after it.  I can't think of any sensible definition
of invalidation by which one can say that i2 is invalidated but i1
isn't.
</p>

<p>
(This issue is important if you try to reason about iterator validity
based only on the guarantees in the standard, rather than reasoning
from typical implementation techniques.  Strict debugging modes,
which some programmers find useful, do not use typical implementation
techniques.)
</p>


<p id="res-414"><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
In 23.3.13.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/vector.modifiers">[vector.modifiers]</a> paragraph 3, change "Invalidates all the
iterators and references after the point of the erase" to
"Invalidates iterators and references at or after the point of the
erase". 
</p>


<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>I believe this was essentially a typographical error, and that it
  was taken for granted that erasing an element invalidates iterators
  that point to it.  The effects clause in question treats iterators
  and references in parallel, and it would seem counterintuitive to
  say that a reference to an erased value remains valid.</p>
