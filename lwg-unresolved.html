<p>
A third party test suite tries to exercise <tt>istream::ignore(N)</tt> with a negative value of 
<tt>N</tt> and expects that the implementation will treat <tt>N</tt> as if it were <tt>0</tt>. Our 
implementation asserts that (<tt>N &gt;= 0</tt>) holds and aborts the test.
</p>

<p>
I can't find anything in section 27 that prohibits such values but I don't
see what the effects of such calls should be, either (this applies to
a number of unformatted input functions as well as some member functions
of the <tt>basic_streambuf</tt> template).

I propose that we add to each function in clause 27 that takes an argument, say <tt>N</tt>, of type 
<tt>streamsize</tt> a <i>Requires</i> clause saying that "<tt>N &gt;= 0</tt>." The intent is to allow

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>From comp.std.c++:</p>

<p>
I note that given an input iterator a for type <tt>T</tt>, 
then <tt>*a</tt> only has to be "convertable to <tt>T</tt>", 
not actually of type <tt>T</tt>.
</p>

<p>Firstly, I can't seem to find an exact definition of "convertable to <tt>T</tt>". 
While I assume it is the obvious definition (an implicit conversion), I 
can't find an exact definition. Is there one?</p>

<p>Slightly more worryingly, there doesn't seem to be any restriction on 
the this type, other than it is "convertable to <tt>T</tt>". Consider two input 
iterators <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>. I would personally assume that most people would 
expect <tt>*a==*b</tt> would perform <tt>T(*a)==T(*b)</tt>, however it doesn't seem that 
the standard requires that, and that whatever type <tt>*a</tt> is (call it <tt>U</tt>) 
could have == defined on it with totally different symantics and still 
be a valid inputer iterator.</p>

<p>Is this a correct reading? When using input iterators should I write 
<tt>T(*a)</tt> all over the place to be sure that the object I'm using is the 
class I expect?</p>

<p>This is especially a nuisance for operations that are defined to be
  "convertible to <tt>bool</tt>".  (This is probably allowed so that
  implementations could return say an <tt>int</tt> and avoid an unnecessary
  conversion. However all implementations I have seen simply return a
  <tt>bool</tt> anyway.  Typical implementations of STL algorithms just write
  things like <tt>while(a!=b &amp;&amp; *a!=0)</tt>.  But strictly
  speaking, there are lots of types that are convertible to <tt>T</tt> but
  that also overload the appropriate operators so this doesn't behave
  as expected.</p>

<p>If we want to make code like this legal (which most people seem to
  expect), then we'll need to tighten up what we mean by "convertible
  to <tt>T</tt>".</p>

<p><i>[Lillehammer: The first part is NAD, since "convertible" is
 well-defined in core. The second part is basically about pathological

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
A problem with TR1 regex is currently being discussed on the Boost 
developers list. It involves the handling of case-insensitive matching 
of character ranges such as [Z-a]. The proper behavior (according to the 
ECMAScript standard) is unimplementable given the current specification 
of the TR1 <tt>regex_traits&lt;&gt;</tt> class template. John Maddock, the author of 
the TR1 regex proposal, agrees there is a problem. The full discussion 
can be found at http://lists.boost.org/boost/2005/06/28850.php (first 
message copied below). We don't have any recommendations as yet.
</p>
<p>
-- Begin original message --
</p>
<p>
The situation of interest is described in the ECMAScript specification
(ECMA-262), section 15.10.2.15:
</p>
<p>
"Even if the pattern ignores case, the case of the two ends of a range
is significant in determining which characters belong to the range.
Thus, for example, the pattern /[E-F]/i matches only the letters E, F,
e, and f, while the pattern /[E-f]/i matches all upper and lower-case
ASCII letters as well as the symbols [, \, ], ^, _, and `."
</p>
<p>
A more interesting case is what should happen when doing a
case-insensitive match on a range such as [Z-a]. It should match z, Z,
a, A and the symbols [, \, ], ^, _, and `. This is not what happens with
Boost.Regex (it throws an exception from the regex constructor).
</p>
<p>
The tough pill to swallow is that, given the specification in TR1, I
don't think there is any effective way to handle this situation.
According to the spec, case-insensitivity is handled with
<tt>regex_traits&lt;&gt;::translate_nocase(CharT)</tt> &mdash; two characters are equivalent
if they compare equal after both are sent through the <tt>translate_nocase</tt>
function. But I don't see any way of using this translation function to
make character ranges case-insensitive. Consider the difficulty of
detecting whether "z" is in the range [Z-a]. Applying the transformation
to "z" has no effect (it is essentially <tt>std::tolower</tt>). And we're not
allowed to apply the transformation to the ends of the range, because as
ECMA-262 says, "the case of the two ends of a range is significant."
</p>
<p>
So AFAICT, TR1 regex is just broken, as is Boost.Regex. One possible fix
is to redefine translate_nocase to return a string_type containing all
the characters that should compare equal to the specified character. But
this function is hard to implement for Unicode, and it doesn't play nice
with the existing ctype facet. What a mess!
</p>

<p><i>[
John Maddock adds:

<p>
One small correction, I have since found that ICU's regex package does 
implement this correctly, using a similar mechanism to the current 
TR1.Regex.
</p>
<p>
Given an expression [c1-c2] that is compiled as case insensitive it:
</p>
<p>
Enumerates every character in the range c1 to c2 and converts it to it's 
case folded equivalent.  That case folded character is then used a key to a 
table of equivalence classes, and each member of the class is added to the 
list of possible matches supported by the character-class.  This second step 
isn't possible with our current traits class design, but isn't necessary if 
the input text is also converted to a case-folded equivalent on the fly.
</p>
<p>
ICU applies similar brute force mechanisms to character classes such as 
[[:lower:]] and [[:word:]], however these are at least cached, so the impact 
is less noticeable in this case.
</p>
<p>
Quick and dirty performance comparisons show that expressions such as 
"[X-\\x{fff0}]+" are indeed very slow to compile with ICU (about 200 times 
slower than a "normal" expression).  For an application that uses a lot of 
regexes this could have a noticeable performance impact.  ICU also has an 
advantage in that it knows the range of valid characters codes: code points 
outside that range are assumed not to require enumeration, as they can not 
be part of any equivalence class.  I presume that if we want the TR1.Regex 
to work with arbitrarily large character sets enumeration really does become 
impractical.
</p>
<p>
Finally note that Unicode has:
</p>
<p>
Three cases (upper, lower and title).
One to many, and many to one case transformations.
Character that have context sensitive case translations - for example an 
uppercase sigma has two different lowercase forms  - the form chosen depends 
on context(is it end of a word or not), a caseless match for an upper case 
sigma should match either of the lower case forms, which is why case folding 
is often approximated by tolower(toupper(c)).
</p>
<p>
Probably we need some way to enumerate character equivalence classes, 
including digraphs (either as a result or an input), and some way to tell 
whether the next character pair is a valid digraph in the current locale.
</p>
<p>
Hoping this doesn't make this even more complex that it was already,

This issue appears to be unresolved (should not be NAD).

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>



<p>
33.6.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.mutex.requirements">[thread.mutex.requirements]</a> describes the requirements for a type to be
a "Mutex type". A Mutex type can be used as the template argument for
the <tt>Lock</tt> type that's passed to <tt>condition_variable_any::wait</tt> (although
<tt>Lock</tt> seems like the wrong name here, since <tt>Lock</tt> is given a different
formal meaning in 33.6.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.lock">[thread.lock]</a>) and, although the WD doesn't quite say
so, as the template argument for <tt>lock_guard</tt> and <tt>unique_lock</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The requirements for a Mutex type include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<tt>m.lock()</tt> shall be well-formed and have [described] semantics, including a return type of <tt>void</tt>.
</li>
<li>
<tt>m.try_lock()</tt> shall be well-formed and have [described] semantics, including a return type of <tt>bool</tt>.
</li>
<li>
<tt>m.unlock()</tt> shall be well-formed and have [described] semantics, including a return type of <tt>void</tt>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, a Mutex type "shall not be copyable nor movable".
</p>

<p>
The latter requirement seems completely irrelevant, and the three
requirements on return types are tighter than they need to be. For
example, there's no reason that <tt>lock_guard</tt> can't be instantiated with a
type that's copyable. The rule is, in fact, that <tt>lock_guard</tt>, etc. won't
try to copy objects of that type. That's a constraint on locks, not on
mutexes. Similarly, the requirements for <tt>void</tt> return types are
unnecessary; the rule is, in fact, that <tt>lock_guard</tt>, etc. won't use any
returned value. And with the return type of <tt>bool</tt>, the requirement should
be that the return type is convertible to <tt>bool</tt>.

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>
The intention is not only to place a constraint on what types such as
<tt>lock_guard</tt> may do with mutex types, but on what any code, including user
code, may do with mutex types. Thus the constraints as they are apply to
the mutex types themselves, not the current users of mutex types in the
standard.
</li>
<li>
This is a low priority issue; the wording as it is may be overly
restrictive but this may not be a real issue.

<blockquote>
<p>
Section 33.6.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.mutex.requirements">[thread.mutex.requirements]</a> conflates the
requirements on a generic Mutex type (including user-supplied mutexes)
with the requirements placed on the standard-supplied mutex types in an
attempt to group everything together and save space.
</p>
<p>
When applying concepts to chapter 30, I suggest that the concepts
<tt>Lockable</tt> and <tt>TimedLockable</tt> embody the requirements for
*use* of a mutex type as required by
<tt>unique_lock/lock_guard/condition_variable_any</tt>. These should be
relaxed as Pete describes in the issue. The existing words in 33.6.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.mutex.requirements">[thread.mutex.requirements]</a> are requirements on all of
<tt>std::mutex</tt>, <tt>std::timed_mutex</tt>,

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
I have the impression that even the wording of current draft
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2857.pdf">N2857</a>
does insufficiently express the intent of <tt>vector</tt>'s
reallocation strategy. This has produced not too old library
implementations which release memory in the <tt>clear()</tt> function
and even modern articles about C++ programming cultivate
the belief that <tt>clear</tt> is allowed to do exactly this. A typical
example is something like this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
const int buf_size = ...;
std::vector&lt;T&gt; buf(buf_size);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; some_condition; ++i) {
  buf.resize(buf_size);
  write_or_read_data(buf.data());
  buf.clear(); // Ensure that the next round get's 'zeroed' elements
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
where still the myth is ubiquitous that <tt>buf</tt> might be
allowed to reallocate it's memory <b>inside</b> the <tt>for</tt> loop.
</p>
<p>
IMO the problem is due to the fact, that
</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<li>
the actual memory-reallocation stability of <tt>std::vector</tt>
is explained in 24.3.11.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/vector.capacity">[vector.capacity]</a>/3 and /6 which
are describing just the effects of the <tt>reserve</tt>
function, but in many examples (like above) there
is no explicit call to <tt>reserve</tt> involved. Further-more
24.3.11.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/vector.capacity">[vector.capacity]</a>/6 does only mention <em>insertions</em>

easily causes a misunderstanding, because the counter
parting insert functions described in 24.3.11.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/vector.modifiers">[vector.modifiers]</a>/2
explicitly say, that
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Causes reallocation if the new size is greater than the
old capacity. If no reallocation happens, all the iterators
and references before the insertion point remain valid.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
It requires a complex argumentation chain about four
different places in the standard to provide the &mdash; possibly
weak &mdash; proof that calling <tt>clear()</tt> also does <em>never</em> change
the capacity of the <tt>std::vector</tt> container. Since <tt>std::vector</tt>
is the de-facto replacement of C99's dynamic arrays this
type is near to a built-in type and it's specification should
be clear enough that usual programmers can trust their

<p>
When I look at the <tt>unordered_*</tt> constructors, I think the complexity is poorly
described and does not follow the style of the rest of the standard.
</p>

<p>
The complexity for the default constructor is specified as constant.
Actually, it is proportional to <tt>n</tt>, but there are no invocations of
<tt>value_type</tt> constructors or other <tt>value_type</tt> operations.
</p>

<p>
For the iterator-based constructor the complexity should be:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Complexity:</i> exactly <tt>n</tt> calls to construct <tt>value_type</tt>
from <tt>InputIterator::value_type</tt> (where <tt>n = distance(f,l)</tt>).
The number of calls to <tt>key_equal::operator()</tt> is proportional to
<tt>n</tt> in the average case and <tt>n*n</tt> in the worst case.

</blockquote>

<p><i>[2011-02-26: Daniel provides wording]</i></p>


<p>I strongly suggest to clean-up the differences between requirement tables and individual
specifications. In the usual way, the most specific specifications wins, which is in this
case the wrong one. In regard to the concern expressed about missing <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>
requirements of the value type I disagree: The function argument <tt>n</tt> is no size-control
parameter, but only some effective capacity parameter: No elements will be value-initialized
by these constructors. The necessary requirement for the value type, <tt>EmplaceConstructible</tt>
into <tt>*this</tt>, is already listed in Table 103 &mdash; Unordered associative container requirements.
Another part of the proposed resolution is the fact that there is an inconsistency of the
complexity counting when both a range <strong>and</strong> a bucket count is involved compared
to constructions where only bucket counts are provided: E.g. the construction <tt>X a(n);</tt>
has a complexity of <tt>n</tt> bucket allocations, but this part of the work is omitted for
<tt>X a(i, j, n);</tt>, even though it is considerable larger (in the average case) for 
<tt>n &#8811; distance(i, j)</tt>.

<p><i>[2012, Kona]</i></p>

<p>
Fix up some presentation issues with the wording, combining the big-O expressions into single
expressions rather than the sum of two separate big-Os.
</p>
<p>
Strike "constant or linear", prefer "linear in the number of buckets".
This allows for number of buckets being larger than requested <tt>n</tt> as well.
</p>
<p>
Default <tt>n</tt> to "unspecified" rather than "implementation-defined".  It seems an un-necessary
burden asking vendors to document a quantity that is easily determined through the public API of
these classes.

<p>
Replace <tt>distance(f,l)</tt> with "number of elements in the range <tt>[f,l)</tt>"
</p>
<p>
Retain in Review with the updated wording
</p>

<p><i>[2012, Portland: Move to Open]</i></p>

<p>
The wording still does not call out Pablo's original concern, that the element constructor is called
no more than <tt>N</tt> times, and that the <tt>N</tt> squared term applies to moves during rehash.
</p>

<p>
Inconsistent use of O(n)+O(N) vs. O(n+N), with a preference for the former.
</p>

<p>
AJM to update wording with a reference to "no more than <tt>N</tt> element constructor calls".
</p>

<p>
Matt concerned that calling out the O(n) requirements is noise, and dangerous noise in suggesting a precision
we do not mean.  The cost of constructing a bucket is very different to constructing an element of user-supplied
type.
</p>

<p>
AJM notes that if there are multiple rehashes, the 'n' complexity is probably not linear.
</p>

<p>
Matt suggests back to Open, Pablo suggests potentially NAD if we keep revisitting without achieving a resolution.
</p>

<p>
Matt suggests complexity we are concerned with is the number of operations, such as constructing elements, moving
nodes, and comparing/hashing keys.  We are less concerned with constructing buckets, which are generally noise in
this bigger picture.

<p>
AM: essentially correct, but do we want to complicate the spec?
<p/>
HH: Pablo has given us permission to NAD it
<p/>
JM: when I look at the first change in the P/R I find it mildly disturbing that the existing wording says you have a 
constant time constructor with a single element even if your <tt>n</tt> is 10^6, so I think adding this change makes people 
aware there might be a large cost in initializing the hash table, even though it doesn't show up in user-visible constructions.
<p/>
HH: one way to avoid that problem is make the default ctor <tt>noexcept</tt>. Then the container isn't allowed to create 
an arbitrarily large hash table
<p/>
AM: but this is the constructor where the user provides <tt>n</tt>
<p/>
MC: happy with the changes, except I agree with the editorial recommendation to keep the two &#x1d4aa;s separate.

<p/>
HH: suggest we take the suggestion to split &#x1d4aa;(n+N) to &#x1d4aa;(n)+&#x1d4aa;(N) and move to Tentatively Ready
<p/>
GR: 23.2.1p2 says all complexity requirements are stated solely in terms of the number of operations on the contained 
object, so we shouldn't be stating complexity in terms of the hash table initialization
<p/>
HH: channeling Pete, there's an implicit "unless otherwise specified" everywhere.
<p/>
VV: seem to be requesting modifications that render this not Tentatively Ready
<p/>
GR: I think it can't be T/R

<p><i>[2019-03-17; Daniel comments and provides revised wording]</i></p>

<p>
The updated wording ensures that we can now specify complexity requirements for containers even when they are <em>not</em>
expressed in terms of the number on the contained objects by an exception of the rule. This allows us to say that
<tt>&#x1d4aa;(n)</tt> describes the complexity in terms of bucket initialization instead.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The terms <em>valid</em> iterator and <em>singular</em> aren't
properly defined. The fuzziness of those terms became even worse
after the resolution of <a href="208">208</a> (including further updates by <a href="278">278</a>). In
25.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.requirements">[iterator.requirements]</a> as of
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2723.pdf">N2723</a>
the standard says now:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
5 - These values are called past-the-end values. Values of an iterator <tt>i</tt> for
which the expression <tt>*i</tt> is defined are called dereferenceable. The library
never assumes that past-the-end values are dereferenceable. Iterators
can also have singular values that are not associated with any
container. [...] Results of most expressions are undefined for singular
values; the only exceptions are destroying an iterator that holds a
singular value and the assignment of a non-singular value to an iterator
that holds a singular value. [...] Dereferenceable values are always
non-singular.
</p>

<p>
10 - An invalid iterator is an iterator that may be singular.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
First, issue <a href="208">208</a> intentionally removed the earlier constraint that past-the-end
values are always non-singular. The reason for this was to support null
pointers as past-the-end iterators of e.g. empty sequences. But there
seem to exist different views on what a singular (iterator) value is. E.g.
according to the <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/trivial.html">SGI definition</a>
a null pointer is <em>not</em> a singular value:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Dereferenceable iterators are always nonsingular, but the converse is
not true.
For example, a null pointer is nonsingular (there are well defined operations
involving null pointers) even thought it is not dereferenceable.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
and <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/InputIterator.html">proceeds</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
An iterator is valid if it is dereferenceable or past-the-end.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Even if the standard prefers a different meaning of singular here, the
change was incomplete, because by restricting feasible expressions of singular
iterators to destruction and assignment isn't sufficient for a past-the-end
iterator: Of-course it must still be equality-comparable and in general be a readable value.
</p>

<p>
Second, the standard doesn't clearly say whether a past-the-end value is
a valid iterator or not. E.g. 27.11 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/specialized.algorithms">[specialized.algorithms]</a>/1 says:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
In all of the following algorithms, the formal template parameter <tt>ForwardIterator</tt> 
is required to satisfy the requirements of a forward iterator (24.1.3)
[..], and is required to have the property that no exceptions are thrown from [..], or
dereference of valid iterators.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The standard should make better clear what "singular pointer" and "valid
iterator" means. The fact that the meaning of a valid <em>value</em>
has a core language meaning doesn't imply that for an iterator concept
the term "valid iterator" has the same meaning.
</p>

<p>
Let me add a final example: In 99 [allocator.concepts.members] of
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2914.pdf">N2914</a>
we find:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
pointer X::allocate(size_type n);
</pre>

<blockquote><p>
11 <i>Returns:</i> a pointer to the allocated memory. [<i>Note:</i> if <tt>n == 0</tt>, the return
value is unspecified. &mdash;<i>end note</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
[..]
</p>

<pre>
void X::deallocate(pointer p, size_type n);
</pre>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Preconditions:</i> <tt>p</tt> shall be a non-singular pointer value obtained from a call
to <tt>allocate()</tt> on this allocator or one that compares equal to it.
</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
If singular pointer value would include null pointers this make the
preconditions
unclear if the pointer value is a result of <tt>allocate(0)</tt>: Since the return value
is unspecified, it could be a null pointer. Does that mean that programmers
need to check the pointer value for a null value before calling deallocate?

<h3><a name="1238" href="1238">1238.</a> Defining algorithms taking iterator for range</h3>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The library has many algorithms that take a source range represented by
a pair of iterators, and the start of some second sequence given by a
single iterator. Internally, these algorithms will produce undefined
behaviour if the second 'range' is not as large as the input range, but
none of the algorithms spell this out in Requires clauses, and there is
no catch-all wording to cover this in clause 17 or the front matter of
25.
</p>

<p>
There was an attempt to provide such wording in paper <a href="https://wg21.link/n2944">n2944</a>
but this seems incidental to the focus of the paper, and getting the wording of
this issue right seems substantially more difficult than the simple
approach taken in that paper.  Such wording will be removed from an
updated paper, and hopefully tracked via the LWG issues list instead.
</p>

<p>
It seems there are several classes of problems here and finding wording
to solve all in one paragraph could be too much.  I suspect we need
several overlapping requirements that should cover the desired range of
behaviours.
</p>

<p>
Motivating examples:
</p>

<p>
A good initial example is the <tt>swap_ranges</tt> algorithm.  Here there is a
clear requirement that <tt>first2</tt> refers to the start of a valid range at
least as long as the range <tt>[first1, last1)</tt>.  <a href="https://wg21.link/n2944">n2944</a> tries to solve this
by positing a hypothetical <tt>last2</tt> iterator that is implied by the
signature, and requires <tt>distance(first2,last2) &lt; distance(first1,last1)</tt>.
 This mostly works, although I am uncomfortable assuming that <tt>last2</tt> is
clearly defined and well known without any description of how to obtain
it (and I have no idea how to write that).
</p>

<p>
A second motivating example might be the <tt>copy</tt> algorithm.  Specifically,
let us image a call like:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
copy(istream_iterator&lt;int&gt;(is),istream_iterator(),ostream_iterator&lt;int&gt;(os));
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In this case, our input iterators are literally simple <tt>InputIterators</tt>,
and the destination is a simple <tt>OutputIterator</tt>.  In neither case am I
happy referring to <tt>std::distance</tt>, in fact it is not possible for the
<tt>ostream_iterator</tt> at all as it does not meet the requirements.  However,
any wording we provide must cover both cases.  Perhaps we might deduce
<tt>last2 == ostream_iterator&lt;int&gt;{}</tt>, but that might not always be valid for
user-defined iterator types.  I can well imagine an 'infinite range'
that writes to <tt>/dev/null</tt> and has no meaningful <tt>last2</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The motivating example in <a href="https://wg21.link/n2944">n2944</a> is <tt>std::equal</tt>, 
and that seems to fall somewhere between the two.
</p>

<p>
Outlying examples might be <tt>partition_copy</tt> that takes two output
iterators, and the <tt>_n</tt> algorithms where a range is specified by a
specific number of iterations, rather than traditional iterator pair. 
We should also <em>not</em> accidentally apply inappropriate constraints to
<tt>std::rotate</tt> which takes a third iterator that is not intended to be a
separate range at all.
</p>

<p>
I suspect we want some wording similar to:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
For algorithms that operate on ranges where the end iterator of the
second range is not specified, the second range shall contain at least
as many elements as the first.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
I don't think this quite captures the intent yet though.  I am not sure
if 'range' is the right term here rather than sequence.  More awkwardly,
I am not convinced we can describe an Output sequence such as produce by
an <tt>ostream_iterator</tt> as "containing elements", at least not as a
precondition to the call before they have been written.
</p>

<p>
Another idea was to describe require that the trailing iterator support
at least distance(input range) applications of <tt>operator++</tt> and may be
written through the same number of times if a mutable/output iterator.
</p>

<p>
We might also consider handling the case of an output range vs. an input
range in separate paragraphs, if that simplifies how we describe some of
these constraints.

<p>
<tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt> iterators are not random access iterators
because their reference type is a special class, and not
<tt>bool &amp;</tt>. All standard libary operations taking iterators
should treat this iterator as if it was a random access iterator, rather
than a simple input iterator.
</p>

<p><i>[
Resolution proposed in ballot comment

<p>
Either revise the iterator requirements to support proxy iterators
(restoring functionality that was lost when the Concept facility was
removed) or add an extra paragraph to the <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt>
specification requiring the library to treat <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt>
iterators as-if they were random access iterators, despite having the wrong
reference type.
</p>

<p><i>[

<p>
The consensus at Rapperswil is that it is too late for full support for
proxy iterators, but requiring the library to respect <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt>
iterators as-if they were random access would be preferable to flagging
this container as deliberately incompatible with standard library algorithms.

<p>
33.5.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.lockfree">[atomics.lockfree]</a> p.8 states:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
An atomic store shall only store a value that has
been computed from constants and program input values
by a finite sequence of program evaluations, such
that each evaluation observes the values of variables
as computed by the last prior assignment in the
sequence.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
... but 6.9.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.execution">[intro.execution]</a> p.13 states:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If A is not sequenced before B and B is not
sequenced before A, then A and B are unsequenced.
[ <em>Note</em>: The execution of unsequenced
evaluations can overlap. &mdash; <em>end note</em> ]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Overlapping executions can make it impossible to
construct the sequence described in 33.5.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.lockfree">[atomics.lockfree]</a> p.8. We are not
sure of the intention here and do not offer a suggestion for
change, but note that 33.5.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.lockfree">[atomics.lockfree]</a> p.8 is the condition that prevents
out-of-thin-air reads.
</p>
<p>
For an example, suppose we have a function invocation
f(e1,e2). The evaluations of e1 and e2 can overlap.
Suppose that the evaluation of e1 writes y and reads x
whereas the evaluation of e2 reads y and writes x, with
reads-from edges as below (all this is within a single
thread).
</p>
<pre>
 e1           e2
Wrlx y--   --Wrlx x
      rf\ /rf
         X
        / \
Rrlx x&lt;-   -&gt;Rrlx y
</pre>
<p>
This seems like it should be allowed, but there seems to
be no way to produce a sequence of evaluations with the
property above.
</p>
<p>
In more detail, here the two evaluations, e1 and e2, are
being executed as the arguments of a function and are
consequently not sequenced-before each other. In
practice we'd expect that they could overlap (as allowed
by 6.9.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.execution">[intro.execution]</a> p.13), with the two writes taking effect before the two
reads. However, if we have to construct a linear order of
evaluations, as in 33.5.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.lockfree">[atomics.lockfree]</a> p.8, then the execution above is not
permited. Is that really intended?

<p><i>[2011-03-09 Hans comments:]</i></p>


<p>I'm not proud of 33.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p9 (formerly p8), and I agree with the comments that this
isn't entirely satisfactory. 33.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p9 was designed to preclude
out-of-thin-air results for races among <tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt> atomics, in spite of 
the fact that Java experience has shown we don't really know how to do that adequately. In 
the long run, we probably want to revisit this.
<p/>
However, in the short term, I'm still inclined to declare this NAD, for two separate reasons:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>6.9.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.execution">[intro.execution]</a> p15 states: "If a side effect on a scalar
object is unsequenced relative to either another side
effect on the same scalar object or a value computation
using the value of the same scalar object, the behavior is undefined."
I think the examples presented here have undefined behavior as a result.
It's not completely clear to me whether examples can be constructed
that exhibit this problem, and don't have undefined behavior.</p></li>

<li><p>This comment seems to be using a different meaning of "evaluation"
from what is used elsewhere in the standard. The sequence of evaluations
here doesn't have to consist of full expression evaluations.  They
can be evaluations of operations like lvalue to rvalue conversion,
or individual assignments. In particular, the reads and writes
executed by <tt>e1</tt> and <tt>e2</tt> in the example could be treated as separate
evaluations for purposes of producing the sequence.
The definition of "sequenced before" in 6.9.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.execution">[intro.execution]</a> makes
little sense if the term "evaluation" is restricted to any notion
of complete expression. Perhaps we should add yet another note
to clarify this?  33.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p10 probably leads to 
the wrong impression here.
<p/>
An alternative resolution would be to simply delete our flakey
attempt at preventing out-of-thin-air reads, by removing 33.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p9-11,
possibly adding a note that explains that we technically allow,
but strongly discourage them. If we were starting this from scratch
now, that would probably be my preference.  But it seems like too drastic
a resolution at this stage.

<p>
The standard doesn't say that containers should use abstract pointer 
types internally. Both Howard and Pablo agree that this is the intent. 
Further, it is necessary for containers to be stored, for example, in 
shared memory with an interprocess allocator (the type of scenario that 
allocators are intended to support).
</p>
<p>
In spite of the (possible) agreement on intent, it is necessary to make 
this explicit:
</p>
<p>
An implementations may like to store the result of dereferencing the 
pointer (which is a raw reference) as an optimization, but that prevents 
the data structure from being put in shared memory, etc. In fact, a 
container could store raw references to the allocator, which would be a 
little weird but conforming as long as it has one by-value copy. 
Furthermore, pointers to locales, ctypes, etc. may be there, which also 
prevents the data structure from being put in shared memory, so we 
should make explicit that a container does not store raw pointers or 
references at all.

<p>During the Pittsburgh meeting the proposal <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3066.html">N3066</a>
became accepted because it fixed several severe issues related to the iterator specification. But the current working draft (N3225)
does not reflect all these changes. Since I'm unaware whether every correction can be done editorial, this issue is submitted to take
care of that. To give one example: All expressions of Table 108 &mdash; &quot;Output iterator requirements&quot; have a post-condition
that the iterator is incrementable. This is impossible, because it would exclude any finite sequence that is accessed by an output 
iterator, such as a pointer to a C array. The N3066 wording changes did not have these effects.
</p>

<p><i>[2011-03-01: Daniel comments:]</i></p>


<p>This issue has some overlap with the issue <a href="2038">2038</a> and I would prefer if we
could solve both at one location. I suggest the following approach:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The terms <tt><i>dereferencable</i></tt> and <tt><i>incrementable</i></tt> could be defined in a more
general way not restricted to iterators (similar to the concepts <tt>HasDereference</tt> and 
<tt>HasPreincrement</tt> from working draft N2914). But on the other hand, all current usages of 
<tt><i>dereferencable</i></tt> and <tt><i>incrementable</i></tt> are involved with types that satisfy 
iterator requirements. Thus, I believe that it is sufficient for C++0x to add corresponding definitions to 
25.3.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.requirements.general">[iterator.requirements.general]</a> and to let all previous usages of these terms refer to this 
sub-clause. Since the same problem occurs with the past-the-end iterator, this proposal suggest providing 
similar references to usages that precede its definition as well.
</p></li>
<li><p>We also need to ensure that all iterator expressions get either an operational semantics in
terms of others or we need to add missing pre- and post-conditions. E.g. we have the following
ones without semantics:
</p><blockquote><pre>
*r++ = o // output iterator
*r--     // bidirectional iterator
</pre></blockquote><p>
According to the <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/OutputIterator.html">SGI specification</a>
these correspond to
</p><blockquote><pre>
{ *r = o; ++r; }                         // output iterator
{ reference tmp = *r; --r; return tmp; } // bidirectional iterator
</pre></blockquote><p>
respectively. Please note especially the latter expression for bidirectional iterator. It fixes a problem
that we have for forward iterator as well: Both these iterator categories provide stronger guarantees
than input iterator, because the result of the dereference operation is <tt>reference</tt>, and <strong>not</strong>
only convertible to the value type (The exact form from the SGI documentation does not correctly refer to
<tt>reference</tt>).
</p></li>
</ol>

<p><i>[2011-03-14: Daniel comments and updates the suggested wording]</i></p>


<p>In addition to the before mentioned necessary changes there is another one need, which
became obvious due to issue <a href="2042">2042</a>: <tt>forward_list&lt;&gt;::before_begin()</tt> returns
an iterator value which is not dereferencable, but obviously the intention is that it should
be incrementable. This leads to the conclusion that imposing dereferencable as a requirement
for the expressions <tt>++r</tt> is wrong: We only need the iterator to be incrementable. A
similar conclusion applies to the expression <tt>--r</tt> of bidirectional iterators.</p>

<p><i>[
2011 Bloomington
]</i></p>


<p>
Consensus this is the correct direction, but there are (potentially) missing <i>incrementable</i>
preconditions on some table rows, and the Remarks on when an output iterator becomes dereferencable
are probably better handled outside the table, in a manner similar to the way we word for input
iterators.
</p>

<p>
There was some concern about redundant pre-conditions when the operational semantic is defined in
terms of operations that have preconditions, and a similar level of concern over dropping such
redundancies vs. applying a consistent level of redundant specification in all the iterator tables.
Wording clean-up in either direction would be welcome.
</p>

<p><i>[2011-08-18: Daniel adapts the proposed resolution to honor the Bloomington request]</i></p>


<p>
There is only a small number of further changes suggested to get rid of superfluous 
requirements and essentially non-normative assertions. Operations should not have extra 
pre-conditions, if defined by "in-terms-of" semantics, see e.g. <tt>a != b</tt> or <tt>a-&gt;m</tt> 
for Table 107. Further, some remarks, that do not impose anything or say nothing new have been removed, 
because I could not find anything helpful they provide.
E.g. consider the remarks for Table 108 for the operations dereference-assignment and
preincrement: They don't provide additional information say nothing surprising. With the
new pre-conditions <em>and</em> post-conditions it is implied what the remarks intend to say.

<p>
The following sentence is dropped from the standard section on OutputIterators:
<p/>
"In particular, the following two conditions should hold: first, any
iterator value should be assigned through before it is incremented
(this is, for an output iterator <tt>i, i++; i++;</tt> is not a valid code
sequence); second, any value of an output iterator may have at most
one active copy at any given time (for example, <tt>i = j; *++i = a; *j = b;</tt> 
is not a valid code sequence)."
</p>

<p><i>[
2011-11-04: Daniel comments and improves the wording
]</i></p>


<p>
In regard to the first part of the comment, the intention of the newly proposed wording 
was to make clear that for the expression
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
*r = o
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
we have the precondition dereferenceable and the post-condition
incrementable. And for the expression
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
++r
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
we have the precondition incrementable and the post-condition dereferenceable 
or past-the-end. This <em>should not</em>  allow for a sequence like <tt>i++; i++;</tt> 
but I agree that it doesn't exactly say that.
<p/>
In regard to the second point: To make this point clearer, I suggest to
add a similar additional wording as we already have for input iterator to the 
"Assertion&#47;note" column of the expression <tt>++r</tt>:
<p/>
"Post: any copies of the previous value of <tt>r</tt> are no longer 
required to be dereferenceable or incrementable."

<p>In comp.lang.c++, Vicente Botet raises the following questions:</p>

<blockquote><p>
&quot;In "24.2.4 Output iterators" there are 3 uses of incrementable. I've
not found the definition. Could some one point me where it is defined?
<p/>
Something similar occurs with dereferenceable. While the definition is
given in "24.2.1 In general" it is used several times before.
<p/>
Shouldn't these definitions be moved to some previous section?&quot;
</p></blockquote>

<p>He's right: both terms are used without being properly defined.
<p/>
There is no definition of "incrementable".
<p/>
While there is a definition of "dereferenceable", it is, in fact, a definition of 
"dereferenceable iterator". "dereferenceable" is used throughout Clause 23 (Containers) 
before its definition in Clause 24. In almost all cases it's referring to iterators, 
but in 16.4.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/swappable.requirements">[swappable.requirements]</a> there is a mention of "dereferenceable object"; in 
16.4.4.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/allocator.requirements">[allocator.requirements]</a> the table of Descriptive variable definitions refers to a 
"dereferenceable pointer"; 20.2.3.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/pointer.traits.functions">[pointer.traits.functions]</a> refers to a 
"dereferenceable pointer"; in 30.4.6.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/locale.time.get.virtuals">[locale.time.get.virtuals]</a>&#47;11 (<tt>do_get</tt>) 
there is a requirement that a pointer "shall be dereferenceable". In those specific cases 
it is not defined.

<p>
The currently agreed on proposed wording for <a href="2015">2015</a> using 
<tt>remove_all_extents&lt;T&gt;::type</tt> instead of the "an array of 
unknown bound" terminology in the precondition should be extended to 
some further entries especially in Table 49, notably the 
<tt>is_*constructible</tt>, <tt>is_*assignable</tt>, and 
<tt>is_*destructible</tt> entries. To prevent ODR violations, incomplete
element types of arrays must be excluded for value-initialization and
destruction for example. Construction and assignment has to be honored, 
when we have array-to-pointer conversions or pointer conversions of
incomplete pointees in effect.
</p>

<p><i>[2012, Kona]</i></p>

<p>
The issue is that in three type traits, we are accidentally saying that in certain
circumstances the type must give a specified answer when given an incomplete type.
(Specifically: an array of unknown bound of incomplete type.)  The issue asserts
that there's an ODR violation, since the trait returns false in that case but might
return a different version when the trait is completed.
</p>
<p>
Howard argues: no, there is no risk of an ODR violation.
<tt>is_constructible&lt;A[]></tt> must return <tt>false</tt> regardless of whether
<tt>A</tt> is complete, so there's no reason to forbid an array of unknown bound of
incomplete types. Same argument applies to <tt>is_assignable</tt>. General agreement
with Howard's reasoning.
</p>
<p>
There may be a real issue for <tt>is_destructible</tt>. None of us are sure what
<tt>is_destructible</tt> is supposed to mean for an array of unknown bound
(regardless of whether its type is complete), and the standard doesn't make it clear.
The middle column doesn't say what it's supposed to do for incomplete types.
</p>
<p>
In at least one implementation, <tt>is_destructible&lt;A[]></tt> does return <tt>true</tt>
if <tt>A</tt> is complete, which would result in ODR violation unless we forbid it for
incomplete types.
</p>
<p>
Move to open. We believe there is no issue for <tt>is_constructible</tt> or
<tt>is_assignable</tt>, but that there is a real issue for <tt>is_destructible</tt>.

<p>
Andrzej Krzemienski reported the following on comp.std.c++:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In N3290, which is to become the official standard, in 17.9.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/terminate">[terminate]</a>,
paragraph 1 reads
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Remarks</i>: Called by the implementation when exception handling must
be abandoned for any of several reasons (15.5.1), in effect immediately after 
evaluating the <em>throw-expression</em> (18.8.3.1). May also be called directly by the 
program.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not clear what is "in effect". It was clear in previous drafts where paragraphs 
1 and 2 read:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Called by the implementation when exception handling must be
abandoned for any of several reasons (15.5.1). May also be called directly
by the program.
<p/>
<i>Effects</i>: Calls the <tt>terminate_handler</tt> function in effect
immediately after evaluating the <em>throw-expression</em> (18.8.3.1), if called by the
implementation, or calls the current <tt>terminate_handler</tt> function,
if called by the program.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It was changed by N3189. The same applies to function unexpected (D. 11.4, paragraph 1).
<p/>
Assuming the previous wording is still intended, the wording can be read
"unless <tt>std::terminate</tt> is called by the program, we will use the handler
that was in effect immediately after evaluating the throw-expression".
<p/>
  This assumes that there is some throw-expression connected to every
  situation that triggers the call to <tt>std::terminate</tt>. But this is not
  the case:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  In case <tt>std::thread</tt> is assigned to or destroyed while being joinable
  there is no throw-expression involved.
</li>
<li>
  In case <tt>std::unexpected</tt> is called by the program, <tt>std::terminate</tt> is
  triggered by the implementation - no throw-expression involved.
</li>
<li>
  In case a destructor throws during stack unwinding we have two throw-expressions 
  involved.
 </li>
 </ul>
<p>
Which one is referred to?
<p/>
In case <tt>std::nested_exception::rethrow_nested</tt> is called for an object that has 
captured no exception, there is no throw-expression involved directly (and may no throw 
be involved even indirectly).
<p/>
Next, 17.9.5.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/terminate.handler">[terminate.handler]</a>, paragraph 2 says 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Required behavior</i>: A <tt>terminate_handler</tt> shall terminate execution
of the program without returning to the caller.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This seems to allow that the function may exit by throwing an
exception (because word "return" implies a normal return).
<p/>
One could argue that words "terminate execution of the program" are sufficient,
but then why "without returning to the caller" would be mentioned. In
case such handler throws, noexcept specification in function <tt>std::terminate</tt> 
is violated, and <tt>std::terminate</tt> would be called recursively - should 
<tt>std::abort</tt> not be called in case of recursive <tt>std::terminate</tt> 
call? On the other hand some controlled recursion could be useful, like in the 
<a href="http://cplusplus.co.il/2010/03/21/catching-uncaught-exceptions-within-terminate/">following technique</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The here mentioned wording changes by N3189 in regard to 17.9.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/terminate">[terminate]</a> p1 
were done for a better separation of effects (Effects element) and additional normative 
wording explanations (Remarks element), there was no meaning change intended. Further,
there was already a defect existing in the previous wording, which was not updated when 
further situations where defined, when <tt>std::terminate</tt> where supposed to be 
called by the implementation. 
<p/>
The part
<p/>
"in effect immediately after evaluating the throw-expression"
<p/>
should be removed and the quoted reference to 17.9.5.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/terminate.handler">[terminate.handler]</a> 
need to be part of the effects element where it refers to the current <tt>terminate_handler</tt> 
function, so should be moved just after
<p/>
"Effects: Calls the current <tt>terminate_handler</tt> function."
<p/>
It seems ok to allow a termination handler to exit via an exception, but the 
suggested idiom should better be replaced by a more simpler one based on
evaluating the current exception pointer in the terminate handler, e.g.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void our_terminate (void) {
  std::exception_ptr p = std::current_exception();
  if (p) {
    ... // OK to rethrow and to determine it's nature
  } else {
    ... // Do something else
  }
}
</pre></blockquote>

This example is ill-formed according to C++11 because <tt>uses_allocator&lt;promise&lt;R&gt;, A&gt;::value</tt> is true, but
<tt>is_constructible&lt;promise&lt;R&gt;, A, promise&lt;R&gt;&amp;&amp;&gt;::value</tt> is false. Similarly for <tt>packaged_task</tt>.

This is an allocator issue, and should be dealt with directly by LWG.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
Recently I received a Service Request (SR) alleging that one of our testcases causes an 
undefined behavior. The complaint is that 28.6.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/template.mask.array">[template.mask.array]</a> in C++11 
(and the corresponding subclause in C++03) are interpreted by some people to require that 
in an assignment "<tt>a[mask] = b</tt>", the subscript <tt>mask</tt> and the rhs <tt>b</tt> 
must have the same number of elements.
<p/>
IMHO, if that is the intended requirement, it should be stated explicitly.
<p/>
In any event, there is a tiny editorial cleanup that could be made:
<p/>
In C++11, 28.6.8.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/template.mask.array.overview">[template.mask.array.overview]</a> para 2 mentions
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"the expression <tt>a[mask] = b;</tt>"
</p></blockquote>
<p>
but the semicolon cannot be part of an expression. The correction could omit the 
semicolon, or change the word "expression" to "assignment" or "statement".
<p/>
Here is the text of the SR, slightly modified for publication:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Subject:  SR01174 LVS _26322Y31 has undefined behavior [open]
<p/>
[Client:]<br/>
The test case t263.dir&#47;_26322Y31.cpp seems to be illegal as it has an undefined 
behaviour. I searched into the SRs but found SRs were not related to the topic 
explained in this mail (SR00324, SR00595, SR00838).
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
const char vl[] = {"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"};
const char vu[] = {"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"};
const std::valarray&lt;char&gt; v0(vl, 27), vm5(vu, 5), vm6(vu, 6);
std::valarray&lt;char&gt; x = v0;
[&hellip;]
const bool vb[] = {false, false, true, true, false, true};
const std::valarray&lt;bool&gt; vmask(vb, 6);
x = v0;
x[vmask] = vm5;      // ***** HERE....
steq(&amp;x[0], "abABeCghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz");
x2 = x[vmask];       // ***** ....AND HERE

<p/>
[Plum Hall:]<br/>
Before I log this as an SR, I need to check one detail with you.
<p/>
I did read the email thread you mentioned, and I did find a citation (see INCITS ISO&#47;IEC 14882-2003 
Section 26.3.2.6 on valarray computed assignments):
<p/>
Quote: "If the array and the argument array do not have the same length, the behavior is undefined",
<p/>
But this applies to computed assignment (<tt>*=</tt>, <tt>+=</tt>, etc), not to simple assignment. Here is the C++03 citation 
re simple assignment:
<p/>
26.3.2.2 valarray assignment [lib.valarray.assign]
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
valarray&lt;T&gt;&amp; operator=(const valarray&lt;T&gt;&amp;);
</pre><blockquote>
<p>
1 Each element of the <tt>*this</tt> array is assigned the value of the corresponding element of the argument array.
The resulting behavior is undefined if the length of the argument array is not equal to the length of the
<tt>*this</tt> array.
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
In the new C++11 (N3291), we find ...
<p/>
26.6.2.3 valarray assignment [valarray.assign]
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
valarray&lt;T&gt;&amp; operator=(const valarray&lt;T&gt;&amp; v);
</pre><blockquote>
<p>
1 Each element of the <tt>*this</tt> array is assigned the value of the corresponding element of the argument
array. If the length of <tt>v</tt> is not equal to the length of <tt>*this</tt>, resizes <tt>*this</tt> to make 
the two arrays the same length, as if by calling <tt>resize(v.size())</tt>, before performing the assignment.
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
So it looks like the testcase might be valid for C++11 but not for C++03; what do you think?
<p/>
[Client:]<br/>
I quite agree with you but the two problems I mentioned:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
x[vmask] = vm5;      // ***** HERE....
[&hellip;]
x2 = x[vmask];       // ***** ....AND HERE
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
refer to <tt>mask_array</tt> assignment hence target the C++03 26.3.8 paragraph. Correct?
<p/>
[Plum Hall:]<br/>
I mentioned the contrast between C++03 26.3.2.2 para 1 versus C++11 26.6.2.3 para 1.
<p/>
But in C++03 26.3.8, I don't find any corresponding restriction. Could you quote the specific 
requirement you're writing about?
<p/>
[Client:]<br/>
I do notice the difference between c++03 26.3.2.2 and c++11 26.6.2.3 about assignments between 
different sized <tt>valarray</tt> and I perfectly agree with you.
<p/>
But, as already stated, this is not a simple <tt>valarray</tt> assignment but a
<tt>mask_array</tt> assignment (c++03 26.3.8 &#47; c++11 26.6.8). See c++11 quote below:
<p/>
26.6.8 Class template mask_array<br/>
26.6.8.1 Class template mask_array overview<br/>
[....]
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>This template is a helper template used by the mask subscript operator:
<tt>mask_array&lt;T&gt; valarray&lt;T&gt;::operator[](const valarray&lt;bool&gt;&amp;)</tt>.
</p></li>
<li><p>It has reference semantics to a subset of an array specified by a boolean mask. Thus, 
the expression <tt>a[mask] = b;</tt> has the effect of assigning <em>the elements of <tt>b</tt></em> 
to the masked elements in <tt>a</tt> (those for which the corresponding element in <tt>mask</tt> is true.)
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
26.6.8.2 mask_array assignment
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void operator=(const valarray&lt;T&gt;&amp;) const;
const mask_array&amp; operator=(const mask_array&amp;) const;
</pre><blockquote>
<p>
1 These assignment operators have reference semantics, assigning the values of the argument array 
elements to selected elements of the <tt>valarray&lt;T&gt;</tt> object to which it refers.
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
In particular, [one of the WG21 experts] insisted on the piece "the elements of <tt>b</tt>".
<p/>
That is why I reported the test t263.dir&#47;_26322Y31.cpp having an undefined behaviour.
<p/>
[Plum Hall:]<br/>
OK, I can see that I will have to ask WG21; I will file an appropriate issue 
with the Library subgroup. In the meantime, I will mark this testcase as "DISPUTED" 
so that it is not required for conformance testing, until we get a definitive opinion.

There appears to be a real need for clarification in the standard, and
implementations differ in their current interpretation.  This will need
some research by implementers and a proposed resolution before further

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
IMO if we specified <tt>is_[nothrow_]constructible</tt> in terms of a variable
declaration whose validity requires destructibility, it is clearly a bug
in our specification and a failure to realize the actual original
intent. The specification should have been in terms of placement-new.
<p/>
Daniel:<br/>
At the time of the specification this was intended and the solution is
<em>not</em> done by removing the destruction semantics of <tt>is_constructible</tt>.
<p/>
The design of <tt>is_constructible</tt> was also impacted by the previous
<tt>Constructible</tt> concept that <em>explicitly</em> contained destruction semantics,
because during conceptification of the library it turned out to simplify
the constraints  in the library because you did not need to add
<tt>Destructible</tt> all the time. It often was implied but never spoken out
in C++03.
<p/>
Pure construction semantics was considered as useful as well, so <tt>HasConstructor</tt>
did also exist and would surely be useful as trait as well.
<p/>
Another example that is often overlooked: This also affects wrapper types like <tt>pair</tt>,
<tt>tuple</tt>, <tt>array</tt> that contain potentially more than one type:
This is easy to understand if you think of <tt>T1</tt> having a deleted destructor
and <tt>T2</tt> having a constructor that may throw: Obviously the compiler has
potentially need to use the <tt>destructor</tt> of <tt>T1</tt> in the <em>constructor</em>
of <tt>std::pair&lt;T1, T2&gt;</tt> to ensure that the core language requirements
are satisfied (All previous fully constructed sub-objects must be destructed).
<p/>
The core language also honors this fact in  [class.copy] p11:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
A defaulted copy&#47;move constructor for a class <tt>X</tt> is defined as deleted (9.5.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/dcl.fct.def.delete">[dcl.fct.def.delete]</a>)
if <tt>X</tt> has:<br/>
[&hellip;]<br/>
&mdash; any direct or virtual base class or non-static data member of a type with a destructor that is deleted
or inaccessible from the defaulted constructor,<br/>
[&hellip;]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Dave:<br/>
This is about <tt>is_nothrow_constructible</tt> in particular. The fact that it is
foiled by not having a <tt>noexcept</tt> dtor is a defect.
</p>

<p><i>[2012, Kona]</i></p>

<p>
Move to Open.
</p>
<p>
<tt>is_nothrow_constructible</tt> is defined in terms of <tt>is_constructible</tt>, which is defined
by looking at a hypothetical variable and asking whether the variable definition is known not to
throw exceptions. The issue claims that this also examines the type's destructor, given the context,
and thus will return <tt>false</tt> if the destructor can potentially throw. At least one
implementation (Howard's) does return <tt>false</tt> if the constructor is <tt>noexcept(true)</tt>
and the destructor is <tt>noexcept(false)</tt>. So that's not a strained interpretation.
The issue is asking for this to be defined in terms of placement <tt>new</tt>, instead of in terms
of a temporary object, to make it clearer that <tt>is_nothrow_constructible</tt> looks at the
<tt>noexcept</tt> status of only the constructor, and not the destructor.
</p>
<p>
Sketch of what the wording would look like:
</p>
<p>
require <tt>is_constructible</tt>, and then also require that a placement <tt>new</tt> operation
does not throw. (Remembering the title of this issue... What does this imply for <tt>swap</tt>?
</p>
<p>
If we accept this resolution, do we need any changes to <tt>swap</tt>?
</p>
<p> STL argues: no, because you are already forbidden from passing anything with a throwing
destructor to <tt>swap</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Dietmar argues: no, not true. Maybe statically the destructor can conceivably throw for some
values, but maybe there are some values known not to throw. In that case, it's correct to
pass those values to <tt>swap</tt>.

<p>
Iostreams should include a manipulator to toggle grouping on&#47;off for
locales that support grouped digits. This has come up repeatedly and
been deferred. See LWG <a href="826">826</a> for the previous attempt.
<p/>
If one is using a locale that supports grouped digits, then output
will always include the generated grouping characters. However, very
plausible scenarios exist where one might want to output the number,
un-grouped. This is similar to existing manipulators that toggle
on&#47;off the decimal point, numeric base, or positive sign.

This is a feature request.

<p>
Walter is slightly uncomfortable with processing feature requests through the issues lists.
</p>
<p>
Alisdair says this is far from the first feature request that has come in from the issues list.
</p>
<p>
STL: The fact that you can turn off grouping on hex output is compelling.
</p>
<p>
Marshall: if we add this flag, we'll need to update tables 87-91 as well.
</p>
<p>
STL: If it has been implemented somewhere, and it works, we'd be glad to add it.
</p>
<p>
Howard: We need to say what the default is.
</p>
<p>
Alisdair sumarizes:
</p>
<p>
(1) We want clear wording that says what the effect is of turning the flag off;
</p>
<p>
(2) what the default values are, and
</p>
<p>
(3) how this fits into tables 87-90. (and 128)

<p>
The front matter in clause 17 should clarify that postconditions will not hold if a 
standard library function exits via an exception. Postconditions or guarantees that 
apply when an exception is thrown (beyond the basic guarantee) are described in an 
"Exception safety" section.
</p>

<p><i>[
2012-10 Portland: Move to Open
]</i></p>


<p>
Consensus that we do not clearly say this, and that we probably should.  A likely
location to describe the guarantees of <i>postconditions</i> could well be a new
sub-clause following 99 [res.on.required] which serves the same purpose
for <i>requires</i> clauses. However, we need such wording before we can make
progress.
</p>

<p>
Also, see <a href="2137">2137</a> for a suggestion that we want to see a paper resolving
both issues together.

<p>MC: Idea is to replace all such "If no exception" postconditions with "Exception safety" sections.</p>

<p><i>[2021-06-20; Daniel comments]</i></p>

<p>
An informal <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/3612">editorial change suggestion</a> has 
recently been made whose editorial implementation would promote the idea that the default assumption is 
that <i>Postconditions:</i> are only met if the function doesn't exit with an exception.
<p/>
After analyzing all current existing <i>Postconditions:</i> elements the following seems to hold: Affected
by this issue are only non-<tt>noexcept</tt> functions and mostly non-constructor functions (unless the 
<i>Postconditions:</i> element says something about the value of its arguments). Most existing
<i>Postconditions</i> seem to be intended to apply only in non-exceptional cases. I found some where
this is presumably not intended, namely those of the expressions <tt>os &lt;&lt; x</tt> and
<tt>is &gt;&gt; v</tt> in Tables [tab:rand.req.eng] and [tab:rand.req.dist], maybe also 
29.11.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.zone.db.remote">[time.zone.db.remote]</a> p4.
<p/>
Nonetheless, the editorial change seems to be applicable even without having this issue resolved, because 
it doesn't actually change the normative state by itself.

The default expectation in the library is that post-conditions only hold, if there is no failure

There is also a concern that this is just one example of where we would want to apply

<a href="2136">2136</a> is a paper providing the clause 17 wording that gives the guarantee
for <i>postcondition</i> paragraphs, and then reviews clauses 18-30 to apply that

</p>
<blockquote><p>
The template definitions in the C++ standard library refer to various named requirements whose details are set out in

As far as I understand, we can explicitly specify template arguments for <tt>std::swap</tt> and <tt>std::for_each</tt>. 
Can we use reference types there?

<p>
When the first argument of this constructor is an lvalue (e.g. a name of a global function), template argument for <tt>F</tt> 
is deduced to be lvalue reference type. What should "<tt>MoveConstructible</tt>" mean with regard to an lvalue reference

LWG <a href="2146">2146</a> and opined that the P/R of LWG <a href="2716">2716</a> should restrict to forwarding 
references, where the deduction to lvalue references can happen without providing an explicit template
argument just by providing an lvalue function argument.

<p>
For the examples given in the original report, the <tt>for_each</tt>
case is now banned, because 27.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/algorithms.requirements">[algorithms.requirements]</a> p15
forbids explicit template argument lists. <tt>std::thread</tt>'s constructor
has also been fixed to describe the requirements on <tt>decay_t&lt;T&gt;</tt>
instead of <tt>T</tt>.
</p>
<p>
We believe we're more careful these days about using <tt>remove_cvref</tt>
or <tt>decay</tt> as needed, but there are still places where we incorrectly
state requirements in terms of types that might be references.
The <tt>swap</tt> case still needs solving. Still need a survey.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Sub-clause 16.4.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/swappable.requirements">[swappable.requirements]</a> defines two notions of swappability: a binary version defining
when two objects are <em>swappable with</em> one another, and a unary notion defining whether an object is 
<em>swappable</em> (without qualification), with the latter definition requiring that the object satisfy the 
former with respect to all values of the same type.
<p/>
Let <tt>T</tt> be a container type based on a non-propagating allocator whose instances do not necessarily 
compare equal. Then sub-clause 24.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a> p7 implies that no object <tt>t</tt> 
of type <tt>T</tt> is swappable (by the unary definition).
<p/>
Throughout the standard it is the unary definition of "swappable" that is listed as a requirement (with the 
exceptions of 22.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/utility.swap">[utility.swap]</a> p4, 22.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/pairs.pair">[pairs.pair]</a> p31, 22.4.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/tuple.swap">[tuple.swap]</a> p2, 
27.7.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/alg.swap">[alg.swap]</a> p2, and 27.7.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/alg.swap">[alg.swap]</a> p6, which use the binary definition). This renders 
many of the mutating sequence algorithms of sub-clause 27.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/alg.modifying.operations">[alg.modifying.operations]</a>, for example, 
inapplicable to sequences of standard container types, even where every element of the sequence is swappable 
with every other.
<p/>
Note that this concern extends beyond standard containers to all future allocator-based types.
<p/>
Resolution proposal:
<p/>
I see two distinct straightforward solutions:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
<li>Modify the requirements of algorithms from sub-clause 27.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/alg.modifying.operations">[alg.modifying.operations]</a>, and all other
places that reference the unary "swappable" definition, to instead use the binary "swappable with" definition 
(over a domain appropriate to the context). The unary definition of "swappable" could then be removed from the 
standard.
</li>
<li>Modify sub-clause 24.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a> such that objects of standard container types 
are "swappable" by the unary definition.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I favor the latter solution, for reasons detailed in the following issue.
</p>

<p><i>[
2012-10 Portland: Move to Open 
]</i></p>


<p>
The issue is broader than containers with stateful allocotors, although they are the most obvious
example contained within the standard itself.  The basic problem is that once you have a stateful
allocator, that does not <tt>propagate_on_swap</tt>, then whether two objects of this type can be
swapped with well defined behavior is a run-time property (the allocators compare equal) rather
than a simple compile-time property that can be deduced from the type.  Strictly speaking, any
type where the nature of swap is a runtime property does not meet the <tt>swappable</tt>
requirements of C++11, although typical sequences of such types are going to have elements that
are all <tt>swappable with</tt> any other element in the sequence (using our other term of art
for specifying requirements) as the common case is a container of elements who all share the
same allocator.
</p>

<p>
The heart of the problem is that the <tt>swappable</tt> requirments demand that any two objects
of the same type be <tt>swappable with</tt> each other, so if any two such objects would not
be <tt>swappable with</tt> each other, then the whole type is never <tt>swappable</tt>.  Many
algorithms in clause 25 are specified in terms of <tt>swappable</tt> which is essentially an
overspecification as all they actually need is that any element in the sequence is <tt>swappable
with</tt> any other element in the sequence.
</p>

<p>
At this point Howard joins the discussion and points out that the intent of introducing the
two swap-related terms was to support <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;::reference</tt> types, and we are
reading something into the wording that was never intended.  Consuses is that regardless of
the intent, that is what the words today say.
</p>

<p>
There is some support to see a paper reviewing the whole of clause 25 for this issue, and
other select clauses as may be necessary.
</p>

<p>
There was some consideration to introducing a note into the front of clause 25 to indicate
<tt>swappable</tt> requirements in the clause should be interpreted to allow such awkward
types, but ultimately no real enthusiasm for introducing a <tt>swappable for clause 25</tt>
requirement term, especially if it confusingly had the same name as a term used with a
subtly different meaning through the rest of the standard.
</p>

<p>
There was no enthusiasm for the alternate resolution of requiring containers with unequal
allocators that do not propagate provide a well-defined swap behavior, as it is not
believed to be possible without giving <tt>swap</tt> linear complexity for such values,
and even then would require adding the constraint that the container element types are
CopyConstructible.
</p>

<p>
Final conclusion: move to open pending a paper from a party with a strong interest in
stateful allocators.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Sub-clause 22.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/utility.swap">[utility.swap]</a> defines a non-member 'swap' function with defined behavior for
all <tt>MoveConstructible</tt> and <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> types. It does not guarantee
constant-time complexity or <tt>noexcept</tt> in general, however this definition does
render all objects of <tt>MoveConstructible</tt> and <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> type swappable
(by the unary definition of sub-clause 16.4.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/swappable.requirements">[swappable.requirements]</a>) in the absence of 
specializations or overloads.
<p/>
The overload of the non-member <tt>swap</tt> function defined in Table 96, however,
defines semantics incompatible with the generic non-member <tt>swap</tt> function,
since it is defined to call a member <tt>swap</tt> function whose semantics are
undefined for some values of <tt>MoveConstructible</tt> and <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> types.
<p/>
The obvious (perhaps naive) interpretation of sub-clause 16.4.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/swappable.requirements">[swappable.requirements]</a> is as a guide to
the "right" semantics to provide for a non-member <tt>swap</tt> function (called in
the context defined by 16.4.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/swappable.requirements">[swappable.requirements]</a> p3) in order to provide interoperable
user-defined types for generic programming. The standard container types don't follow these guidelines.
<p/>
More generally, the design in the standard represents a classic example of "contract narrowing". It 
is entirely reasonable for the contract of a particular <tt>swap</tt> overload to provide <em>more</em> 
guarantees, such as constant-time execution and <tt>noexcept</tt>, than are provided by the <tt>swap</tt> 
that is provided for any <tt>MoveConstructible</tt> and <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> types, but it is <em>not</em> 
reasonable for such an overload to fail to live up to the guarantees it provides for general types when 
it is applied to more specific types. Such an overload or specialization in generic programming is akin 
to an override of an inherited virtual function in OO programming: violating a superclass contract in a
subclass may be legal from the point of view of the language, but it is poor design and can easily lead 
to errors. While we cannot prevent user code from providing overloads that violate the more general 
<tt>swap</tt> contract, we can avoid doing so within the library itself.
<p/>
My proposed resolution is to draw a sharp distinction between member <tt>swap</tt> functions, which provide 
optimal performance but idiosyncratic contracts, and non-member <tt>swap</tt> functions, which should always 
fulfill at least the contract of 22.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/utility.swap">[utility.swap]</a> and thus render objects swappable. The member 
<tt>swap</tt> for containers with non-propagating allocators, for example, would offer constant-time
guarantees and <tt>noexcept</tt> but would only offer defined behavior for values with allocators that compare 
equal; non-member <tt>swap</tt> would test allocator equality and then dispatch to either member <tt>swap</tt> or 
<tt>std::swap</tt> depending on the result, providing defined behavior for all values (and rendering the type
"swappable"), but offering neither the constant-time nor the <tt>noexcept</tt> guarantees.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
Objects of <tt>std::array&lt;T, N&gt;</tt> are supposed to be initialized with aggregate initialization (when 
not the destination of a copy or move). This clearly works when <tt>N</tt> is positive. What happens when <tt>N</tt> 
is zero?  To continue using an (inner) set of braces for initialization, a <tt>std::array&lt;T, 0&gt;</tt> implementation 
must have an array member of at least one element, and let default initialization take care of those secret elements.  
This cannot work when <tt>T</tt> has a set of constructors and the default constructor is deleted from that set.
Solution: Add a new paragraph in 24.3.7.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/array.zero">[array.zero]</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The unspecified internal structure of array for this case shall allow initializations like:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
array&lt;T, 0&gt; a = { };
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
and said initializations must be valid even when <tt>T</tt> is not default-constructible.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>[2012, Portland: Move to Open]</i></p>

<p>
Some discussion to understand the issue, which is that implementations currently have freedom to implement
an empty <tt>array</tt> by holding a dummy element, and so might not support value initialization, which is
surprising when trying to construct an empty container. However, this is not mandated, it is an unspecified
implementation detail.
</p>

<p>
Jeffrey points out that the implication of 24.3.7.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/array.overview">[array.overview]</a> is that this initialization syntax
must be supported by empty <tt>array</tt> objects already. This is a surprising inference that was not
obvious to the room, but consensus is that the reading is accurate, so the proposed resolution is not necessary,
although the increased clarity may be useful.
</p>

<p>
Further observation is that the same clause effectively implies that <tt>T</tt> must always be DefaultConstructible,
regardless of <tt>N</tt> for the same reasons - as an <i>initializer-list</i> may not supply enough values, and the
remaining elements must all be value initialized.
</p>

<p>
Concern that we are dancing angels on the head of pin, and that relying on such subtle implications in wording is
not helpful. We need a clarification of the text in this area, and await wording.
</p>

<p><i>[2015-02 Cologne]</i></p>

<p>
DK: What was the outcome of Portland? AM: Initially we thought we already had the intended behaviour. 
We concluded that <tt>T</tt> must always be <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>, but I'm not sure why. GR: It's p2 in 
<tt>std::array</tt>, "up to <tt>N</tt>". AM: That wording already implies that "<tt>{}</tt>" has to work when <tt>N</tt> 
is zero. But the wording of p2 needs to be fixed to make clear that it does <em>not</em> imply that <tt>T</tt> must be 
<tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>.
<p/>
Conclusion: Update wording, revisit later. 
</p>

<p><i>[2015-10, Kona Saturday afternoon]</i></p>

<p><i>[2018-08-30, Jonathan revises wording following feedback from Daniel Kruegler and Tim Song.]</i></p>

<p>
Daniel noted that it's undefined to compare iterators from different containers,
so <tt>a.begin() != b.begin()</tt> can't be used. That means whether the iterators
from different containers are unique is unobservable anyway.
We can say they don't share the same underlying sequence, which tells users they can't compare them
and tells implementors they can't return value-initialized iterators.
<br/>
Tim noted that it's not sufficient to say the unspecified type in a zero-sized array is DefaultConstructible,
it also needs to be constructible from <tt>= {}</tt>. Also, a zero-sized array should be CopyAssignable.

<p>
The currently proposed wording specifies:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
There is a single element of the aggregate, of an unspecified <i>Cpp17DefaultConstructible</i> 
type that is copy-list-initializable from an empty list.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This doesn't specify which expressions involving zero-sized array specializations are constant expressions. 
24.3.7.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/array.overview">[array.overview]</a> p4 specifies <tt>array&lt;T, 0&gt;</tt> to be a structural type when <tt>T</tt> 
is a structural type. This requires that its single element, let's call it <i>single-element</i>, be a 
structural type. But that says nothing about which of the special member functions of <i>single-element</i> 
are constant expressions. By being a structural type, <i>single-element</i> is permitted to be implemented 
as a literal class type. To meet this requirement, <i>single-element</i> can be implemented to have one 
constexpr constructor that is not a copy or move constructor (6.8.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/basic.types.general">[basic.types.general]</a> p10), so 
its default constructor needn't be constexpr. This is unlike non-zero-sized array specializations, which 
inherit these properties from <tt>T</tt>. Furthermore, this permits an implementation of <i>single-element</i> 
whose default constructor stores the result of <tt>std::source_location::current()</tt> in a data member 
(as exemplified in the specification for <tt>current</tt>). <i>Cpp17DefaultConstructible</i> doesn't 
require the default constructor to produce equal values. The simplest way to solve these issues and any other 
that might arise from future changes and oversights would be to specify <i>single-element</i> as an empty 
aggregate type. Then the wording from 24.3.7.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/array.cons">[array.cons]</a> p1 makes it clear that all the special 
member functions are constant expressions. It would also mean that the default constructor produces 
template-argument-equivalent values.

<p>
There are various operations on <tt>std::vector</tt> that can cause elements of the vector to be 
moved from one location to another. A move operation can use either rvalue or const lvalue as 
argument; the choice depends on the value of <tt>!is_nothrow_move_constructible&lt;T&gt;::value &amp;&amp;
is_copy_constructible&lt;T&gt;::value</tt>, where <tt>T</tt> is the element type. Thus, some operations 
on <tt>std::vector</tt> (e.g. 'resize' with single parameter, 'reserve', 'emplace_back') should have 
conditional requirements. For example, let's consider the requirement for 'reserve' in N3376 &ndash; 
24.3.11.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/vector.capacity">[vector.capacity]</a>&#47;2:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires</i>: <tt>T</tt> shall be <tt>MoveInsertable</tt> into <tt>*this</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This requirement is not sufficient if an implementation is free to select copy constructor when 
<tt>!is_nothrow_move_constructible&lt;T&gt;::value &amp;&amp; is_copy_constructible&lt;T&gt;::value</tt> 
evaluates to true. Unfortunately, <tt>is_copy_constructible</tt> cannot reliably determine whether 
<tt>T</tt> is really copy-constructible. A class may contain public non-deleted copy constructor whose 
definition does not exist or cannot be instantiated successfully (e.g., 
<tt>std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt;&gt;</tt> has copy constructor, but this type is not 
copy-constructible). Thus, the actual requirements should be:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
if <tt>!is_nothrow_move_constructible&lt;T&gt;::value &amp;&amp; is_copy_constructible&lt;T&gt;::value</tt> 
then <tt>T</tt> shall be <tt>CopyInsertable</tt> into <tt>*this</tt>;
</p></li>
<li><p>
otherwise <tt>T</tt> shall be <tt>MoveInsertable</tt> into <tt>*this</tt>.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Maybe it would be useful to introduce a new name for such conditional requirement (in addition to 
"<tt>CopyInsertable</tt>" and "<tt>MoveInsertable</tt>").
</p>

<p><i>[2016-08 Chicago]</i></p>

<p>
The problem does not appear to be as severe as described. The <tt>MoveInsertable</tt>
requirements are consistently correct, but an issue may arise on the
exception-safety guarantees when we check for
<tt>is_copy_constructible_v&lt;T&gt;</tt>.  The problem, as described, is
typically for templates that appear to have a copy constructor, but one that
fails to compile once instantiated, and so gives a misleading result for the
trait.
</p>
<p>
In general, users should not provide such types, and the standard would not
serve users well by trying to address support for such types.  However, the
standard should not be providing such types either, such as
<tt>vector&lt;unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt>.  A possible resolution would be
to tighten the constraints in Table 80 &mdash; Container Requirements, so that if
the Requirements for the copy constructor/assingment operator of a container
are not satisfied, that operation shall be deleted.
</p>
<p>
A futher problem highlighted by this approach is that there are no constraints on
the copy-assignment operator, so that <tt>vector&lt;unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt>
should be <tt>CopyAssignable</tt>! However, we can lift the equivalent constraints from
the Allocator-aware container requirements.

<p>
According to 27.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/algorithms.general">[algorithms.general]</a>/12,
</p>
<blockquote><p>
In the description of the algorithms operators <tt>+</tt> and <tt>-</tt> are used for some of the iterator categories 
for which they do not have to be defined. In these cases the semantics of <tt>a+n</tt> is the same as that of
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
X tmp = a;
advance(tmp, n);
return tmp;
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are several places where such operator <tt>+</tt> is applied to an output iterator &mdash; for example, see the 
description of <tt>std::copy</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class InputIterator, class OutputIterator&gt;
OutputIterator copy(InputIterator first, InputIterator last,
                    OutputIterator result);
</pre>
<blockquote><p>
-1- <i>Effects</i>: Copies elements in the range <tt>[first,last)</tt> into the range <tt>[result,result + (last -
first))</tt> starting from <tt>first</tt> and proceeding to <tt>last</tt>. For each non-negative integer 
<tt>n &lt; (last - first)</tt>, performs <tt>*(result + n) = *(first + n)</tt>.
</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
<tt>std::advance</tt> is not supposed to be applicable to output iterators, so we need a different method of description.
<p/>
See also message <a href="http://listarchives.isocpp.org/cgi-bin/wg21/message?wg=lib&amp;msg=32908">c++std-lib-32908</a>.
</p>

<p><i>[2014-06-07 Daniel comments and provides wording]</i></p>

<p>
The specification for output iterators is somewhat tricky, because here a sequence of increments is required to
be combined with intervening <em>assignments</em> to the dereferenced iterator. I tried to respect this
fact by using a conceptual assignment operation as part of the specification.
<p/>
Another problem in the provided as-if-code is the question which requirements are imposed on <tt>n</tt>. Unfortunately,
the corresponding function <tt>advance</tt> is completely underspecified in this regard, so I couldn't borrow wording
from it. We cannot even assume here that <tt>n</tt> is the difference type of the iterator, because for output iterators there is
no requirements for this associated type to be defined. The presented wording attempts to minimize assumptions, but still
can be considered as controversial.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
The hash functor and key-comparison functor of unordered containers are allowed to throw on <tt>swap</tt>.
</p>
<p>
24.2.8.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unord.req.except">[unord.req.except]</a>p3 "For unordered associative containers, no <tt>swap</tt> function throws
an exception unless that exception is thrown by the swap of the container's Hash or Pred object (if any)."
</p>
<p>
In such a case we must offer the basic exception safety guarantee, where both objects are left in valid
but unspecified states, and no resources are leaked.  This yields a corrupt, un-usable container if the
first <tt>swap</tt> succeeds, but the second fails by throwing, as the functors form a matched pair.
</p>
<p>
So our basic scenario is first, swap the allocators if the allocators propagate on swap, according to
<tt>allocator_traits</tt>.  Next we swap the pointers to our internal hash table data structures, so that
they match the allocators that allocated them.  (Typically, this operation cannot throw).  Now our containers
are back in a safely destructible state if an exception follows.
</p>
<p>
Next, let's say we swap the hash functor, and that throws.  We have a corrupt data structure, in that the
buckets are not correctly indexed by the correct functors, lookups will give unpredicatable results etc.
We can safely restore a usable state by forcibly clearing each container - which does not leak resources
and leaves us with two (empty but) usable containers.
</p>
<p>
Now let us assume that the hasher swap succeeds.  Next we swap the equality comparator functor, and this
too could throw. The important point to bear in mind is that these two functors form an important pairing
- two objects that compare equal by the equality functor must also hash to the same value.  If we swap
one without the other, we most likely leave the container in an unusable state, even if we clear out all
elements.
</p>
<p>
1. A colleague pointed out that the solution for this is to dynamically allocate the two functors, and then
we need only swap pointers, which is not a throwing operation.  And if we don't want to allocate on default
construction (a common QoI request), we might consider moving to a dynamically allocated functors whenever
<tt>swap</tt> is called, or on first insertion.  Of course, allocating memory in <tt>swap</tt> is a whole
new can of worms, but this does not really sound like the design we had intended.
</p>

<p>
2. The simplest option is to say that we do not support hasher or equality functors that throw on ADL
<tt>swap</tt>.  Note that the requirement is simply to not throw, rather than to be explicitly
marked as <tt>noexcept</tt>.  Throwing functors are allowed, so long as we never use values that
would actually manifest a throw when used in an unordered container.
</p>

<p>
Pablo went on to give me several more options, to be sure we have a full set to consider:
</p>
<p>
3. Disallow one or the other functor from throwing.  In that case, the 
possibly-throwing functor must be swapped first, then the other functor, 
the allocator, and the data pointer(s) afterwards (in any order -- there 
was a TC that allocator assignment and swap may not throw if the 
corresponding propagation trait is true.). Of course, the question 
becomes: which functor is allowed to throw and which one is not?
</p>
<p>
4. Require that any successful functor <tt>swap</tt> be reliably reversible.  
This is very inventive.  I know of no other place in the standard where 
such a requirement is stated, though I have occasionally wanted such a 
guarantee.
</p>
<p>
5. Allow a failed swap to leave the containers in a state where future 
insertions may fail for reasons other than is currently allowed.  
Specifically, if the hash and equality functors are out of sync, all 
insertions will fail.  Presumably some "incompletely swapped" exception 
would be thrown.  This is "slightly" inventive, although people have been 
discussing "radioactive" states for a while.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
The user cannot specify a <tt>max_load_factor</tt> for their unordered container
at construction, it must be supplied after the event, when the container is
potentially not empty.  The contract for this method is deliberately vague, not
guaranteeing to use the value supplied by the user, and any value actually used
will be used as a ceiling that the container will <i>attempt</i> to respect.
</p>
<p>
The only guarantee we have is that, if user requests a <tt>max_load_factor</tt>
that is less than the current <tt>load_factor</tt>, then the operation will take
constant time, thus outlawing an implementation that chooses to rehash and so
preserve as a class invariant that <tt>load_factor &lt; max_load_factor</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Reasonable options conforming to the standard include ignoring the user's request
if the requested value is too low, or deferring the rehash to the next <tt>insert</tt>
operation and allowing the container to have a strange state (wrt <tt>max_load_factor</tt>)
until then - and there is still the question of rehashing if the next <tt>insert</tt>
is for a duplicate key in a unique container.
</p>
<p>
Given the deliberate vagueness of the current wording, to support a range of reasonable
(but not <i>perfect</i>) behaviors, it is not clear why the equally reasonable rehash
to restore the constraint should be outlawed.  It is not thought that this is a performance
critical operation, where users will be repeatedly setting low load factors on populated
containers, in a tight or (less unlikely) an instant response scenario.
</p>

<p>Sat PM: Howard to provide wording</p>

<p><i>[2016-11-17 Howard provided wording.]</i></p>


<blockquote>
<p>
The provided wording is consistent with LWG discussion in Issaquah.  An implementation
of the proposed wording would be setting <tt>max_load_factor()</tt> to
<tt>max(z, load_factor())</tt>.  This preserves the container invariant:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
load_factor() &lt;= max_load_factor()
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
And it preserves the existing behavior that no rehash is done by this operation.
</p>
<p>
If it is desired to change the <tt>max_load_factor()</tt> to something smaller than
the current <tt>load_factor()</tt> that can be done by <i>first reducing</i> the
current <tt>load_factor()</tt> by either increasing <tt>bucket_count()</tt> (via
<tt>rehash</tt> or <tt>reserve</tt>), or decreasing <tt>size()</tt> (e.g.
<tt>erase</tt>), <i>and then</i> changing <tt>max_load_factor()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
This resolution reaffirms that <tt>load_factor() &lt;= max_load_factor()</tt> is a
container invariant which can <i>never</i> be violated.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>[2016-11-27, Nico comments]</i></p>

<p>
Current implementations behave differently. 
<p/>
In regard to the sentence
<blockquote>
"The only guarantee we have is that, if user requests a <tt>max_load_factor</tt>
that is less than the current <tt>load_factor</tt>, then the operation will take
constant time, thus outlawing an implementation that chooses to rehash
and so preserve as a class invariant that <tt>load_factor &lt; max_load_factor</tt>."
</blockquote>
Note that the current spec says that there is constant complexity
<em>without</em> any precondition. So, rehashing to keep the invariant would
violate the spec (which is probably not be the intention).

<tt>promise</tt>, <tt>packaged_task</tt>, and <tt>async</tt> are the only
places where a shared state is actually supposed to be allocated. Accordingly,
<tt>promise</tt> and <tt>packaged_task</tt> are "allocator-aware". But

<p>
In 24.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/sequence.reqmts">[sequence.reqmts]</a> p3, we have "<tt>il</tt> designates an object of type
<tt>initializer_list&lt;value_type&gt;</tt>", and then several functions that take
'<tt>il</tt>' as an argument. However, an expression like <tt>{1, 2, 'a'}</tt> is <em>not</em>
an object of type <tt>initializer_list&lt;int&gt;</tt> unless it's used to initialize
an explicitly-typed variable of that type. I believe we want:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::vector&lt;int&gt; v;
v = {1, 2, 'a'};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
to compile portably, so we should say something different when defining '<tt>il</tt>'. The 
same phrasing happens in 24.2.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/associative.reqmts">[associative.reqmts]</a>, 24.2.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unord.req">[unord.req]</a>, and 
28.5.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.req.seedseq">[rand.req.seedseq]</a>.
<p/>
This may just be an editorial issue because the actual class synopses declare the functions 
to take <tt>initializer_list&lt;exact_type&gt;</tt>.

<p>
This is definitely not NAD
</p>
<p>
Should copy the suggested wording as the proposed resolution.
</p>

<p><i>[2019-03-26; Daniel comments and provides wording]</i></p>

<p>
The 2013-03-15 comment is confusing, since it recommends to "copy the suggested wording as the proposed resolution". 
I couldn't find such wording in the issue nor in the associated wiki, so I provided that wording out of myself.
The tricky part is to define which kind of <i>braced-init-list</i> we want to allow. As Tim Song pointed out, we
still need the existing support for <tt>std::initializer_list&lt;value_type&gt;</tt> as well, because otherwise
existing semantics based on expressions such as <tt>li.begin()</tt> won't work anymore.
The below suggested wording restricts supported <i>braced-init-list</i>s to every initializer list that can be used 
to copy-list-initialize an object of type <tt>std::initializer_list&lt;value_type&gt;</tt> by saying:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"<tt>bil</tt> designates any <i>braced-init-list</i> suitable to copy-list-initialize an object of type 
<tt>initializer_list&lt;value_type&gt;</tt> (9.4.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/dcl.init.list">[dcl.init.list]</a>)"
</p></blockquote>
<p>
As a drive-by fix, the provided wording adds another initialization "expression" that makes the construction 
of the form
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::vector&lt;int&gt; v = {1, 2, 'a'};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
valid (We just miss a copy-initialization case).
</p>


<p id="res-2206"><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>This wording is relative to <a href="https://wg21.link/n4810">N4810</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="note">

<p><b>View all issues with</b> <a href="lwg-status.html#Open">Open</a> status.</p>
<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
There is an ambiguity in how <tt>std::basic_ios::init</tt> method (31.5.4.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/basic.ios.cons">[basic.ios.cons]</a>)
can be used in the derived class. The Standard only specify the state of the <tt>basic_ios</tt>
object after the call completes. However, in <tt>basic_ios</tt> default constructor description
(31.5.4.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/basic.ios.cons">[basic.ios.cons]</a>) there is this sentence:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Effects</i>: Constructs an object of class <tt>basic_ios</tt> (31.5.2.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/ios.base.cons">[ios.base.cons]</a>)
leaving its member objects uninitialized. The object shall be initialized by calling <tt>basic_ios::init</tt>
before its first use or before it is destroyed, whichever comes first; otherwise the behavior is undefined.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This restriction hints that <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> should be called exactly
once before the object can be used or destroyed, because <tt>basic_ios::init</tt>
may not know whether it was called before or not (i.e. whether its members are actually
uninitialized or are initialized by the previous call to <tt>basic_ios::init</tt>). There
is no such restriction in the <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> preconditions so it is not clear whether it is
allowed to call <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> multiple times or not.
<p/>
This problem has already affected publicly available implementations.
For example, Microsoft Visual C++ STL introduces a memory leak if
<tt>basic_ios::init</tt> is called multiple times, while GCC 4.7 and STLPort
reinitialize the <tt>basic_ios</tt> object correctly without memory leak or any
other undesired effects. There was a discussion of this issue on Boost
<a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.boost.devel/235659">developers mailing list</a>,
and there is a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/boost-log/ticket/2#comment:4">test case
that reproduces the problem</a>. The test case is actually a bug report for my Boost.Log library,
which attempts to cache <tt>basic_ostream</tt>-derived objects internally to avoid expensive construction
and destruction. My stream objects allowed resetting the stream buffer pointers the stream
is attached to, without requiring to destroy and construct the stream.
<p/>
My personal view of the problem and proposed resolution follows.
<p/>
While apparently the intent of <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> is to provide a way to
initialize <tt>basic_ios</tt> after default construction, I see no reason to
forbid it from being called multiple times to reinitialize the stream.
Furthermore, it is possible to implement a conforming <tt>basic_ios</tt> that
does not have this restriction.
<p/>
The quoted above section of the Standard that describes the effects of
the default constructor is misleading. The Standard does not mandate
any data members of <tt>basic_ios</tt> or <tt>ios_base</tt> (31.5.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/ios.base">[ios.base]</a>), which
it derives from. This means that the implementation is allowed to use
non-POD data members with default constructors that initialize the
members with particular default values. For example, in the case of
Microsoft Visual C++ STL the leaked memory is an <tt>std::locale</tt> instance
that is dynamically allocated during <tt>basic_ios::init</tt>, a raw pointer to
which is stored within ios_base. It is possible to store e.g. an
<tt>unique_ptr</tt> instead of a raw pointer as a member of <tt>ios_base</tt>, the smart
pointer will default initialize the underlying raw pointer on default
construction and automatically destroy the allocated object upon being
reset or destroyed, which would eliminate the leak and allow
<tt>basic_ios::init</tt> to be called multiple times. This leads to conclusion
that the default constructor of <tt>basic_ios</tt> cannot leave "its member
objects uninitialized" but instead performs default initialization of
the member objects, which would mean the same thing in case of POD types.
<p/>
However, I feel that restricting <tt>ios_base</tt> and <tt>basic_ios</tt> members to
non-POD types is not acceptable. Since multiple calls to <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> are
not forbidden by the Standard, I propose to correct the <tt>basic_ios</tt> default
constructor description so that it is allowed to destroy <tt>basic_ios</tt> object
without calling <tt>basic_ios::init</tt>. This would imply that any raw members of
<tt>basic_ios</tt> and <tt>ios_base</tt> should be initialized to values suitable for
destruction (essentially, this means only initializing raw pointers to NULL). The new
wording could look like this:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Effects</i>: Constructs an object of class <tt>basic_ios</tt> (31.5.2.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/ios.base.cons">[ios.base.cons]</a>)
initializing its member objects to unspecified state, only suitable for <tt>basic_ios</tt> destruction.
The object shall be initialized by calling <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> before its first use; otherwise
the behavior is undefined.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This would remove the hint that <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> must be called exactly
once. Also, this would remove the requirement for <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> to
be called at all before the destruction. This is also an important issue because
the derived stream constructor may throw an exception before it manages to call
<tt>basic_ios::init</tt> (for example, if the streambuf constructor throws), and
in this case the <tt>basic_ios</tt> destructor has undefined behavior.
<p/>
To my mind, the described modification is sufficient to resolve the issue. But to
emphasize the possibility to call <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> multiple times, a remark
or a footnote for <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> postconditions could be added to explicitly
state the semantics of calling it multiple times. The note could read as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The function can be called multiple times during the object lifetime. Each subsequent
call reinitializes the object to the described in postconditions initial state.
</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The requirements on the functors used to arrange elements in the various associative and
unordered containers are given by a set of expressions in tables 102 &mdash; Associative container
requirements, and 103 &mdash; Unordered associative container requirements.  In keeping with Library
convention these expressions make the minimal requirements necessary on their types.  For
example, we have the following 3 row extracts for the unordered containers:
</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td>
    <b>Expression</b>
  </td>
  <td>
    <b>Assertion/note pre-/post-condition</b>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
<pre>
<tt>X(n, hf, eq)</tt>
<tt>X a(n, hf, eq)</tt>
</pre>
  </td>
  <td>
    <i>Requires:</i> <tt>hasher</tt> and <tt>key_equal</tt> are <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>.
 </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
<pre>
<tt>X(n, hf)</tt>
<tt>X a(n, hf)</tt>
</pre>
  </td>
  <td>
    <i>Requires:</i> <tt>hasher</tt> is <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> and 
                  <tt>key_equal</tt> is <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>.
 </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
<pre>
<tt>X(n)</tt>
<tt>X a(n)</tt>
</pre>
  </td>
  <td>
    <i>Requires:</i> <tt>hasher</tt> and <tt>key_equal</tt> are <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>.
 </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
However, the signature for each class template requires that the functors must effectively be
<tt>CopyConstructible</tt> for each of these expressions:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class Key,
          class T,
          class Hash  = hash&lt;Key>,
          class Pred  = std::equal_to&lt;Key>,
          class Allocator = std::allocator&lt;std::pair&lt;const Key, T> > >
class unordered_map
{
  <i>...</i>

  <i>// construct/destroy/copy</i>
  explicit unordered_map(size_type n = <i>see below</i>,
                         const hasher&amp; hf = hasher(),
                         const key_equal&amp; eql = key_equal(),
                         const allocator_type&amp; a = allocator_type());

  <i>...</i>
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The letter of the standard can be honored as long as implementors recognize
their freedom to split this one signature into multiple overloads, so that
the documented default arguments (requiring a <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> functor)
are not actually passed as default arguments.
</p>
<p>
As we look into the requirements for the copy constructor and copy-assignment
operator, the requirements are even more vague, as the explicit requirements on
the functors are not called out, other than saying that the functors are copied.
</p>
<p>
Must the functors be <tt>CopyAssignable</tt>? Or is <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>
sufficient in this case?  Do we require that the functors be <tt>Swappable</tt>
so that the copy-swap idiom can be deployed here?  Note that a type that is both
<tt>CopyConstructible</tt> and <tt>CopyAssignable</tt> is still not guaranteed to
be <tt>Swappable</tt> as the user may delete the <tt>swap</tt> function for their
type in their own namespace, which would be found via ADL.
</p>
<p>
Some clean-up of the requirements table looks necessary, to at least document the
assignment behavior.  In addition, we should have clear guidance on whether these
functors should always be <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>, as suggested by the class
template definitions, or if the requirement tables are correct and we should
explicitly split up the constructors in the (unordered) associative containers
to no longer use default (function) arguments to obtain their defaulted functors.
</p>
<p>
I recommend the simplest solution would be to always require that the functors
for (unordered) associative containers be <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>, above the
requirements tables themselves, so that the issue need not be addressed within
the tables.  I suggest that the assignment operators for these containers add
the requirement that the functors be <tt>Swappable</tt>, rather than forwarding
the corresponding <tt>Assignable</tt> requirement.

This appears to require the result to have a default-constructed

suspect the allocator should be copied from 's' instead. Possibly
there should be an additional defaulted argument to override the

Consider the following example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::string str0("x");
std::regex rg0("a");
std::regex_token_iterator it0(str0.begin(), str0.end(), rg0, -1); // points at "x" in str0
std::string str1("x");
std::regex rg1("b");
std::regex_token_iterator it1(str1.begin(), str1.end(), rg1, -1); // points at "x" in str1
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
32.11.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.tokiter.comp">[re.tokiter.comp]</a> p1 says that <tt>it0.operator==(it1)</tt> returns true "if
<tt>*this</tt> and <tt>right</tt> are both suffix iterators and <tt>suffix == right.suffix</tt>"; both
conditions are satisfied in this example. It does not say that they must both be iterators
into the same sequence, nor does it say (as general iterator requirements do) that they must
both be in the domain of <tt>==</tt> in order for the comparison to be meaningful. It's a
simple statement: they're equal if the strings they point at compare equal. Given this being
a valid comparison, the obtained result of "true" looks odd.
<p/>
The problem is that for iterator values prior to the suffix iterator, equality means the same
regular expression and the same matched sequence (both uses of "same" refer to identity, not equality);
for the suffix iterator, equality means that the matched sequences compare equal.

<p>
Table 102 in 24.2.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/associative.reqmts">[associative.reqmts]</a>/8 states on expression <tt>a.key_comp()</tt> that it 
"returns the comparison object out of which a was constructed". At the same time, 
24.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a>/8 states (starting in the third line) that 
"...Any <tt>Compare</tt>, <tt>Pred</tt>, or <tt>Hash</tt> objects belonging to <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> 
shall be swappable and <em>shall be exchanged</em> by unqualified calls to non-member swap...". This is 
problematic for any compliant implementation, since once swapped the container cannot return the comparison 
object out of which it was constructed unless incurring in storing an otherwise needless object.
<p/>
The simple solution is to correct that statement in Table 102, but I believe this is part of a larger problem 
of underspecified behavior: The new standard has made an effort in regards to allocators and now fully 
specifies what happens to stateful allocator objects. It has even specified what happens to stateful <tt>hasher</tt> 
and <tt>key_equal</tt> members of unordered containers (they propagate), but it says nothing about stateful 
comparison objects of (ordered) associative containers, except for the statement in 
24.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a>/8 referred above and only related to <tt>swap</tt>.
<p/>
For example, it is unclear to me what is specified to happen on an assignment: should the comparison object 
be copied/moved along with the elements, or should the left-hand side object keep its own?
Maybe this has been intentionally left unspecified with the purpose of compatibility with C++98, which I 
understand it specified that comparison objects were kept for the entire life of the container (like allocators) 
&mdash; an unfortunate choice. But anyway, the segment of 24.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a> quoted 
above seems to break any possible backwards compatibility with C++98 in this regard.
<p/>
Therefore, taking into consideration consistency with how this is dealed with for unordered associative 
containers, I propose that Table 102 is modified as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The row for expression <tt>a.key_comp()</tt> is changed so that its "assertion/note pre-/post-condition" reads 
"Returns <tt>a</tt>'s comparison object."
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
A new row is added at the appropriate location (which I believe would be after "X(il)" row), with:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1">

VV: libstdc++ already implements the resolution of this issue.

<p/>

<p><i>[2015-10-19 Daniel comments and provides alternative wording]</i></p>

<p>
The current standard is especially unclear in regard to what effects move operations of unordered/associative
containers should have. We have one example that is standardized exactly in this way by looking at 
24.6.7.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/priqueue.cons.alloc">[priqueue.cons.alloc]</a> p7:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template &lt;class Alloc&gt; priority_queue(priority_queue&amp;&amp; q, const Alloc&amp; a);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-7- <i>Effects</i>: Initializes <tt>c</tt> with <tt>std::move(q.c)</tt> as the first argument and <tt>a</tt> as 
the second argument, and initializes <tt>comp</tt> with <tt>std::move(q.comp)</tt>
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
A similarly comparable example are the move-operations of <tt>std::unique_ptr</tt> in regard to the deleter 
(when this is no a reference), which also respect move-capabilities of that function object.
<p/>
We have wording from C++98 for associative containers (but <em>not</em> for unordered containers!) that was never
adjusted to C++11 move-semantics in 24.2.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/associative.reqmts">[associative.reqmts]</a> p12:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
When an associative container is constructed by passing a comparison object the container shall not store
a pointer or reference to the passed object, even if that object is passed by reference. When an associative
container is copied, either through a copy constructor or an assignment operator, the target container shall
then use the comparison object from the container being copied, as if that comparison object had been
passed to the target container in its constructor.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The second sentence of this wording is problematic for several reasons:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It only talks about copy operations, not about move operations, except that the term "assignment" without
leading "copy" is a bit ambigious (albeit it seems clear in the complete context).</p></li>
<li><p>It is not really clear how to interpret "as if that comparison object had been
passed to the target container in its constructor" for an assignment operation. A possible but not conclusive
interpretation could be that this is wording supporting a "copy-via-swap" idiom.</p></li>
<li><p>There does not exist similar wording for unordered containers, except that Table 102 provides entries for
copy construction and copy assignment of the containers whose wording just talks of "copies" in either case.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Existing implementations differ already:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Visual Studio 2015 uses copy construction and copy assignment for the two copy operations but uses swap operations
for the move operations.</p></li>
<li><p>GCC's libstdc++ performs copy construction and copy assignment for the two copy operations and for the two
move operations, respectively</p></li>
<li><p>clang++'s libc++ performs copy/move construction and copy/move assignment for the corresponding
four copy/move operations</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
The alternative wording provided below attempts to clarify that container copy/move operations perform the corresponding
copy/move operations on the owned function objects.
<p/>
In addition the wording also resolves LWG <a href="2215">2215</a>: I believe that the current
wording should require that container function objects should meet the <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> requirements. Adding
this general requirement also fixes the underspecified requirements of the accessor functions <tt>key_comp()</tt> and
<tt>value_comp()</tt>.
<p/>
I don't think that a general requirement for <tt>Swappable</tt> is needed, only the member <tt>swap</tt> function currently requires this.
Nonetheless the wording below does <em>support</em> stateful functors that are <em>also</em> moveable or move-assignable,
therefore the specified semantics in terms of move operations.
<p/>
I should add the following warning, though: If this proposed wording would be accepted, there is a little chance of
code breakage, because the current wording <em>can</em> be read that in general there is no requirement that the
container functors are <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>. The following code example is accepted by gcc + libstd++:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;map&gt;
#include &lt;utility&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct Cmp {
  Cmp() = default;
  Cmp(const Cmp&amp;) = delete;
  Cmp(Cmp&amp;&amp;) = delete;
  Cmp&amp; operator=(const Cmp&amp;) = delete;
  Cmp&amp; operator=(Cmp&amp;&amp;) = delete;
  template&lt;class T&gt;
  bool operator()(const T&amp; x, const T&amp; y) const
  {
    return x &lt; y;
  }
};

typedef std::map&lt;int, int, Cmp&gt; MyMap;

int main() {
  MyMap m;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; (m.find(12) == m.end()) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

<p><i>[2019-04-22, Billy comments]</i></p>

<p>
In addition to the <i>Cpp17CopyConstructible</i> discussion going on there, I think we need to require that 
calling the comparison function when <tt>Compare</tt> itself is <tt>const</tt> needs to produce the same answer

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The "magic" <tt>kill_dependency</tt> function is a function without any constraints on the template parameter <tt>T</tt> 
and is specified as
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;
T kill_dependency(T y) noexcept;
</pre><blockquote>
<p>
-14- <i>Effects</i>: The argument does not carry a dependency to the return value (1.10).
<p/>
-15- <i>Returns</i>: <tt>y</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
I wonder whether the unconditional <tt>noexcept</tt> is really intended here:
Assume we have some type <tt>U</tt> that has a potentially throwing move
constructor (or it has a potentially throwing copy constructor and no
move constructor), for any "normal" function template with the same
signature and the same effects (modulo the dependency magic) this
would mean that it cannot safely be declared <tt>noexcept</tt> because of the
return statement being part of the complete function call affected by
<tt>noexcept</tt> (The by-value function argument is irrelevant in this
context). In other words it seems that a function call such as
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
struct S {
  ...
  S(const S&amp; r) { if(<em>some condition</em>) throw Something(); }
  ...
};

int main() {
  S s1 = ...;
  S s2 = std::kill_dependency(s1);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
would be required to call <tt>std::terminate</tt> if the copy constructor of <tt>S</tt> throws during the return 
of <tt>std::kill_dependency</tt>.
<p/>
To require copy elision for this already magic function would look like a low-hanging fruit to solve this problem, 
but this case is not covered by current copy elision rules see 12.8 p31 b1:
<p/>
"&mdash; in a return statement in a function with a class return type, when the expression is the name of a non-volatile 
automatic object (other than a function or catch-clause parameter) with the same <em>cv</em>-unqualified type as the 
function return type, the copy/move operation can be omitted by constructing the automatic object directly into the
function's return value".
<p/>
Some options come into my mind:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Make the exception-specification a constrained one in regard via <tt>std::is_nothrow_move_constructible</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;
T kill_dependency(T y) noexcept(<em>see below</em>);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This is similar to the approach taken for function templates such as <tt>std::swap</tt>.
</p>
</li>

<li><p>
Use perfect forwarding (This needs further wording to correct the effects):
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;
T&amp;&amp; kill_dependency(T&amp;&amp; y) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>
Impose constraints on the template arguments in regard to throwing exceptions while copying/moving.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Keep the state as it is but possibly add a note about a call of <tt>std::terminate</tt> in above scenario.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
A second problem is that the current wording is not clear whether it is well-defined to call the function with
types that are reference types, such as in the following example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;atomic&gt;

int main()
{
  int a = 12;
  int&amp; b = std::kill_dependency&lt;int&amp;&gt;(a);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
It is unclear what kind of dependency is killed here. This is presumably a core language problem, but could
affect the possible resolutions of the problem.
</p>

<p><i>[2014-11 Urbana]</i></p>

<p>
Recommend using a revised example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
int lookup(class D* p) 
{
  class E* q = p-&gt;a.load(memory_order_consume);
  int y = std::kill_dependency(q-&gt;y);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p><i>[2015-02 Cologne]</i></p>

<p>
Handed over to SG1.

<p>
The non-explicit nature of the iterator-pair constructor of containers, such a
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class InputIterator&gt;
vector(InputIterator first, InputIterator last, const Allocator&amp; = Allocator());
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
can be selected in unexpected situations, leading to a hard runtime error, as demonstrated by the following example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;vector&gt;

void f(std::vector&lt;char&gt; v){ /* ... */}

int main() {
  f({"A", "B"});
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The actually intended initializer-list constructor isn't feasible here, so the best match is the constructor template
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class InputIterator&gt;
vector(InputIterator first, InputIterator last, const Allocator&amp; = Allocator());
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This compiles, but will result in code running amok. The potential trap (that cannot be easily detected by the
library implementation) could be reduced by making this constructor explicit. It would still have the effect to 
be selected here, but the code would be ill-formed, so the programmer gets a clear message here.

<p>
JW: can't fix this, don't want to touch this, Do The Right Thing clause has been a source of tricky issues. 
only really happens with string literals, that's the only way to create an array that isn't obviously an array
<p/>
GR: want to see paper
<p/>
AM: is it only string literals, or also UDLs?
<p/>
STL: maybe, but we don't need to deal with that. This is only a problem in a very specific case

This member should probably be named "is_ieee754". Or at least the standard should explain that IEC-559 no longer exists, 
and that it's been superseded by IEEE-754.
</p>

<p><i>[2016-06, Oulu]</i></p>

<p>The ISO version of the standard is ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011,
which C11 Annex F refers to as IEC 60559
(although C still refers to it as IEC 559 in the <code>__STDC_IEC_559__</code> macro).

N3337 20.3.1.3.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unique.ptr.single.modifiers">[unique.ptr.single.modifiers]</a> contains 2 non-normative notes stating:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[para 4]: &quot;The order of these operations is significant because the call to <tt>get_deleter()</tt> 
may destroy <tt>*this</tt>.&quot;
</p>
<p>
[para 5]: &quot;The postcondition does not hold if the call to <tt>get_deleter()</tt> destroys <tt>*this</tt> since 
<tt>this->get()</tt> is no longer a valid expression.&quot;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It seems this wording was created to resolve <a href="998">998</a> due to the possibility that a <tt>unique_ptr</tt> may be 
destroyed through deletion of its stored pointer where that directly or indirectly refers to the same <tt>unique_ptr</tt>. 
If <tt>unique_ptr</tt> is required to support circular references then it seems this must be normative text: an implementation 
is currently allowed to operate on <tt>*this</tt> after the assignment and deletion specified in para 4, since this is only 
'disallowed' by the non-normative note.
</p>

<p>I propose the following draft rewording:</p>

<p>
[para 4]: <i>Effects</i>: assigns <tt>p</tt> to the stored pointer, and then if the old value of the stored pointer, <tt>old_p</tt>, was not
equal to <tt>nullptr</tt>, calls <tt>get_deleter()(old_p)</tt>. <ins>No operation shall be performed after the call to 
<tt>get_deleter()(old_p)</tt> that requires <tt>*this</tt> to be valid, because the deletion may destroy <tt>*this</tt> if it is 
referred to directly or indirectly by the stored pointer.</ins> <del>[<i>Note:</i> The order of these operations is significant
because the call to <tt>get_deleter()</tt> may destroy <tt>*this</tt>. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]</del>
<p/>
[para 5]: <i>Postconditions</i>: <ins>If the call <tt>get_deleter()(old_p)</tt> destroyed <tt>*this</tt>, none. Otherwise,</ins> 
<tt>get() == p</tt>. <del>[<i>Note:</i> The postcondition does not hold if the call to <tt>get_deleter()</tt>
destroys <tt>*this</tt> since <tt>this->get()</tt> is no longer a valid expression. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]</del>
</p>

<p>
I expect it will also be necessary to amend the requirements for a deleter, so in addition:
</p>

<p>
20.3.1.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unique.ptr.single">[unique.ptr.single]</a> [para 1]: The default type for the template parameter <tt>D</tt> is <tt>default_delete</tt>. 
A client-supplied template argument <tt>D</tt> shall be a function object type (20.10), lvalue-reference to function, or 
lvalue-reference to function object type for which, given a value <tt>d</tt> of type <tt>D</tt> and a value <tt>ptr</tt> of type 
<tt>unique_ptr&lt;T, D&gt;::pointer</tt>, the expression <tt>d(ptr)</tt> is valid and has the effect of disposing of the pointer 
as appropriate for that deleter. <ins>Where <tt>D</tt> is not an lvalue reference type, <tt>d(ptr)</tt> shall be valid if <tt>ptr</tt> 
refers directly or indirectly to the invoking <tt>unique_ptr</tt> object.</ins>
</p>

<p><i>[2013-10-05, Stephan T. Lavavej comments and provides alternative wording]</i></p>

<p>
In Chicago, we determined that the original proposed change to 20.3.1.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unique.ptr.single">[unique.ptr.single]</a>/1 was insufficient, because 
<tt>d</tt> might be a reference to a deleter functor that's destroyed during self-destruction.
<p/>
We believed that 20.3.1.3.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unique.ptr.single.modifiers">[unique.ptr.single.modifiers]</a>/4 was already sufficiently clear. The Standard occasionally prevents 
implementations of <tt>X</tt> from doing various things, through the principle of "nothing allows <tt>X</tt> to fail in that situation".  
For example, <tt>v.push_back(v[0])</tt> is required to work for non-empty vectors because nothing allows that to fail. In this case, 
the intent to allow self-destruction is already clear.
<p/>
Additionally, we did not believe that 20.3.1.3.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unique.ptr.single.modifiers">[unique.ptr.single.modifiers]</a>/5 had to be changed. The current note is slightly 
squirrely but it does not lead to confusion for implementers or users.

<p><i>[2015-05, Lenexa]</i></p>

<p>
After some discussion in Lenexa there was some wavering on if the added sentence is necessary. Here is example code that 
demonstrates why the extra sentence is necessary. In this example the call to <tt>d(ptr)</tt> is valid, however the deleter 
references <tt>*this</tt> after destructing its element:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>

<p>
I believe that the following variation on IRIW should admit executions in
which <tt>c1 = d1 = 5</tt> and <tt>c2 = d2 = 0</tt>.  If this is allowed, then what is sequence of
program evaluations for 33.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p9 that justifies the store to <tt>z</tt>?  It seems that
33.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p9 should not allow this execution because one of the stores to <tt>x</tt> or <tt>y</tt> has
to appear earlier in the sequence, each of the <tt>fetch_adds</tt> reads the previous load in the thread (and thus must 
appear later in the sequence), and 33.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p9 states that each load must read from the last prior 
assignment in the sequence.
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
atomic_int x;
atomic_int y;
atomic_int z;
int c1, c2, d1, d2;

static void a(void* obj)
{
  atomic_store_explicit(&amp;x, 5, memory_order_relaxed); 
}

static void b(void* obj)
{
  atomic_store_explicit(&amp;y, 5, memory_order_relaxed); 
}

static void c(void* obj)
{
  c1 = atomic_load_explicit(&amp;x, memory_order_relaxed);
  // this could also be an atomic load if the address depends on c1:
  c2 = atomic_fetch_add_explicit(&amp;y, c1, memory_order_relaxed);  
}

static void d(void* obj)
{
  d1 = atomic_load_explicit(&amp;y, memory_order_relaxed);
  d2 = atomic_fetch_add_explicit(&amp;x, d1, memory_order_relaxed);

int user_main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  thrd_t t1, t2, t3, t4;

  atomic_init(&amp;x, 0);
  atomic_init(&amp;y, 0);

  printf("Main thread: creating 4 threads\n");
  thrd_create(&amp;t1, (thrd_start_t)&amp;a, NULL);

  atomic_store(&amp;z, (c1+d1)*100+c2+d2);

  printf("Main thread is finished\n");

  return 0;

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
It seems that the easiest fix is to allow a load in 33.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p9 to read from any prior
store in the evaluation order.
<p/>
That said, I would personally advocate the following:
It seems to me that C/C++ atomics are in a bit of different situation than Java
because:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>People are expected to use relaxed C++ atomics in potentially racy
situations, so it isn't clear that semantics as complicated as the JMM's
causality would be sane.
</p></li>
<li><p>People who use C/C++ atomics are likely to be experts and use them in a
very controlled fashion. I would be really surprised if compilers would find
any real wins by optimizing the use of atomics.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Why not do something like:
<p/>
There is satisfaction DAG of all program evaluations. Each evaluation
observes the values of variables as computed by some prior assignment in
the DAG.
<p/>
There is an edge <tt>x-&gt;y</tt> between two evaluations <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> if:

The signature of this function is:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class InputIterator, class RandomAccessIterator&gt;
RandomAccessIterator
partial_sort_copy(InputIterator first, InputIterator last,
                  RandomAccessIterator result_first,
                  RandomAccessIterator result_last);

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
(and the usual overload for an explicitly provided comparison function). The standard says nothing about requirements 
in the case where the input type (<tt>iterator_traits&lt;InputIterator&gt;::value_type</tt>) and the output type 
(<tt>iterator_traits&lt;RandomAccessIterator&gt;::value_type</tt>) are different.
<p/>
Presumably the input type must be convertible to the output type. What's less clear is what the requirements are on 
the comparison operator. Does the algorithm only perform comparisons on two values of the output type, or does it also 
perform comparisons on values of the input type, or might it even perform heterogeneous comparisons?

Consider the following code snippet:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;

int main() {
  std::vector&lt;int&gt; v1(100, 3);
  std::vector&lt;int&gt; v2(100);
  copy(v1.begin(), v1.end(), v2.begin());
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
It compiles without error on my desktop. Is it required to? I can't find evidence from the standard that it is. 
In my test <tt>std::copy</tt> was found by argument-dependent lookup because the implementation I used made 
<tt>std::vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator</tt> a user-defined type defined in namespace <tt>std</tt>. But the standard 
only requires <tt>std::vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator</tt> to be an implementation specified random access iterator 
type. I can't find anything requiring it to be a user-defined type at all (and in fact there are reasonable implementation 
where it isn't), let alone a user defined type defined in a specific namespace.
</p>

<p>
Since the defining namespace of container iterators is visible to users, should the standard say anything about what 
that namespace is?

<p>
In 31.8.2.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/stringbuf.virtuals">[stringbuf.virtuals]</a>/1, <tt>basic_stringbuf::underflow()</tt> is specified to unconditionally 
return <tt>traits::eof()</tt> when a read position is not available.
<p/>
The semantics of <tt>basic_stringbuf</tt> require, and existing libraries implement it so that this function makes 
a read position available if possible to do so, e.g. if some characters were inserted into the stream since the 
last call to <tt>overflow()</tt>, resulting in <tt>pptr() &gt; egptr()</tt>. Compare to the conceptually similar 
D.14.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/depr.strstreambuf.virtuals">[depr.strstreambuf.virtuals]</a>/15.
</p>

<p><i>[2018-06-06, Billy argues for NAD]</i></p>

<p>
The existing "Any character in the underlying buffer which has been initialized is considered to be part of the input sequence." 
sentence already describes what the <tt>stringbuf</tt> is supposed to do to the get area. The specific mechanism that the 
<tt>stringbuf</tt> uses to alter the get area is unspecified because the mechanism by which the <tt>stringbuf</tt> 
remembers the "high water mark" is unspecified.
<p/>
Consider the following:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
stringstream s;
s &lt;&lt; "Hello";
s.seekp(0);
string x;
s &gt;&gt; x;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Before this P/R, this will store <tt>Hello</tt> in <tt>x</tt>, because the characters <tt>Hello</tt> are initialized. 
After this P/R, the "written put area" is empty, so it will store the empty string in <tt>x</tt>.
<p/>
Saying that the initialized part of the string is used already describes what needs to happen here.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The current library specification uses at several places wording that is intended to refer to
core language template deduction failure at the top-level of expressions (aka "SFINAE"), for example:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The expression <tt>declval&lt;T&gt;() = declval&lt;U&gt;()</tt> is well-formed when treated as an unevaluated operand (Clause 5). 
Access checking is performed as if in a context unrelated to <tt>T</tt> and <tt>U</tt>. Only the validity of the immediate context 
of the assignment expression is considered. [<i>Note:</i> The compilation of the expression can result in side effects 
such as the instantiation of class template specializations and function template specializations, the generation of
implicitly-defined functions, and so on. Such side effects are not in the "immediate context" and can result in the program
being ill-formed. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Similar wording can be found in the specification of <tt>result_of</tt>, <tt>is_constructible</tt>, and <tt>is_convertible</tt>,
being added to resolve an NB comment by LWG <a href="1390">1390</a> and <a href="1391">1391</a> through 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3142.html">N3142</a>.
<p/>
This wording is necessary to limit speculative compilations needed to implement these traits, but it is also lengthy and repetitive.
</p>

<p><i>[2014-05-19, Daniel suggests a descriptive term]</i></p>

<p>
<b>constrictedly well-formed expression</b>:
<p/>
An expression <em>e</em> depending on a set of types <tt>A1</tt>, ..., <tt>An</tt> which is well-formed when treated as 
an unevaluated operand (Clause 5). Access checking is performed as if in a context unrelated to <tt>A1</tt>, ..., 
<tt>An</tt>. Only the validity of the immediate context of <em>e</em> is considered. [<i>Note:</i> The compilation of 
the expression can result in side effects such as the instantiation of class template specializations and function 
template specializations, the generation of implicitly-defined functions, and so on. Such side effects are not in the 
"immediate context" and can result in the program being ill-formed. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p>

<p><i>[2014-05-20, Richard and Jonathan suggest better terms]</i></p>

<p>
Richard suggested "locally well-formed"
<p/>
Jonathan suggested "contextually well-formed" and then "The expression ... is valid in a contrived argument
deduction context"
</p>

<p><i>[2014-06-07, Daniel comments and improves wording]</i></p>

<p>
The 2014-05-19 suggestion did only apply to expressions, but there are two important examples that are not expressions, but instead
are involving an <em>object definition</em> (<tt>std::is_constructible</tt>) and a <em>function definition</em> 
(<tt>std::is_convertible</tt>), respectively, instead. Therefore I suggest to rephrase the usage of "expression" into "program 
construct" in the definition of Jonathan's suggestion of "valid in a contrived argument deduction context".
<p/>
I would like to point out that given the new definition of "valid in a contrived argument deduction context", there are several other 
places of the Library specification that could take advantage of this wording to improve the existing specification, such as 
22.10.17.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/func.wrap.func">[func.wrap.func]</a> p2, most functions in 20.2.9.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/allocator.traits.members">[allocator.traits.members]</a>, and the <tt>**Insertable</tt>, 
<tt>EmplaceConstructible</tt>, and <tt>Erasable</tt> definitions in 24.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a>, but given that
these are not fully described in terms of the aforementioned wording <em>yet</em>, I would recommend to fix them by a separate issue 
once the committee has agreed on following the suggestion presented by this issue.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The library gives explicit permission in 16.4.5.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/namespace.std">[namespace.std]</a> p2 that user code may explicitly instantiate
a library template provided that the instantiations depend on at least one user-defined type:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
A program may explicitly instantiate a template defined in the standard library only if the declaration
depends on the name of a user-defined type and the instantiation meets the standard library requirements
for the original template.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
But it seems that the C++11 library is not specified in a way that guarantees such an instantiation to be well-formed
if the minimum requirements of the library is not satisfied. 
<p/>
For example, in general, the first template parameter of <tt>std::vector</tt> is not required to be 
<tt>DefaultConstructible</tt> in general, but due to the split of the single C++03 member function
with default argument
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void resize(size_type sz, T c = T());
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
into
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void resize(size_type sz);
void resize(size_type sz, const T&amp; c);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
the effect is now that for a type <tt>ND</tt> that is not <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>, such as
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct NP { 
  NP(int); 
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
the explicit instantiation of <tt>std::vector&lt;ND&gt;</tt> is no longer well-formed, because the attempt to
instantiate the single-argument overload of <tt>resize</tt> cannot not succeed, because this function imposes
the <tt>DefaultInsertable</tt> requirements and given the default allocator this effectively requires
<tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>.
</p>
<p>
But <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt> is not the only point, what about <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> versus
<tt>MoveConstructible</tt> alone? It turns out that currently the second <tt>resize</tt> overload
would fail during an explicit instantiation for a type like
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct MO { 
  MO() = default; 
  MO(MO&amp;&amp;) = default; 
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
because it imposes <tt>CopyInsertable</tt> requirements that end up being equivalent to the <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>
requirements for the default allocator.
<p/>
Technically a library can solve these issues: For special member functions by defining them in some base class, for others
by transforming them effectively into a function template due to the great feature of default template arguments for
function templates (At the very moment the validity of the latter approach depends on a resolution of core language issue
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_active.html#1635">CWG 1635</a>, though). E.g. the here mentioned 
<tt>resize</tt> functions of <tt>std::vector</tt> could be prevented from instantiation by defining them like this 
with an implementation:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class = void&gt;
void resize(size_type sz) { [&hellip;] }
template&lt;class = void&gt;
void resize(size_type sz, const T&amp; c) { [&hellip;] }
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In this case, these functions could also be defined in a base class, but the latter approach won't work in all cases.
<p/>
Basically such an implementation is required to constrain all member functions that are not covered by the general
requirements imposed on the actual library template parameters. I tested three different C++11 library implementations
and but none could instantiate for example <tt>std::list</tt>, <tt>std::vector</tt>, or <tt>std::deque</tt> with
value types that are not <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt> or only <tt>MoveConstructible</tt>. 
<p/>

<p/>
This issue is raised to clarify the current situation in regard to the actual requirements imposed on user-provided
types that are used to explicitly instantiate Library-provided templates. For example, the current Container requirements
impose very little requirements on the actual value type and it is unclear to which extend library implementations have
to respect that. 
<p/>
The minimum solution of this issue should be to at least realize that there is no fundamental requirement on 
<tt>DefaultConstructible</tt> for value types of library containers, because we have since C++03 the general
statement of 16.4.4.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/utility.arg.requirements">[utility.arg.requirements]</a> ("In general, a default constructor is not required.").
It is unclear whether <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> should be required for an explicit instantiation request, but
given the careful introduction of move operations in the library it would seem astonishing that a
<tt>MoveConstructible</tt> type wouldn't suffice for value types of the container types.
<p/>
In any case I can envision at least two approaches to solve this issue:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
As indicated in LWG <a href="2292">2292</a>, those function could get an explicit "<i>Template Constraints:</i>"
element, albeit this promises more than needed to solve this issue.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The library could introduce a completely new element form, such as "<i>Instantiation Constraints:</i>" that
would handle this situation for explicit instantiation situations. This would allow for simpler techniques
to solve the issue when explicit instantiation is required compared to the first bullet, because it would not 
(necessarily) guarantee SFINAE-friendly expression-wellformedness, such as inspecting the expression 
<tt>std::declval&lt;std::vector&lt;ND&gt;&amp;&gt;.resize(0)</tt> in an unevaluated context.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
It should be noted that the 2013-08-27 comment to LWG <a href="2193">2193</a> could be resolved by a similar solution
as indicated in this issue here.

24.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a>/10 says that unless otherwise specified, "no <tt>swap()</tt> function invalidates 
any references, pointers, or iterators referring to the elements of the containers being swapped. [<i>Note:</i> The <tt>end()</tt>

assignment operators aren't given similar invalidation guarantees. The guarantees need several exceptions, so I do not believe 
that blanket language like /11 "Unless otherwise specified (either explicitly or by defining a function in terms of other functions), 
invoking a container member function or passing a container as an argument to a library function shall not invalidate iterators to, 
or change the values of, objects within that container." is applicable.

The table in 32.4.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.synopt">[re.synopt]</a>/1 says that <tt>regex_constants::collate</tt> "Specifies that character ranges of the form 
"<tt>[a-b]</tt>" shall be locale sensitive.", but 32.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.grammar">[re.grammar]</a>/14 says that it affects individual character comparisons 
too.
</p>

<p>

</p>

</p>

<p><i>[2014-5-14, John Maddock response]</i></p>

<p>
The original intention was the original wording: namely that <tt>collate</tt> only made character ranges locale sensitive.  
To be frank it's a feature that's probably hardly ever used (though I have no real hard data on that), and is a leftover 
from early POSIX standards which <em>required</em> locale sensitive collation for character ranges, and then later changed 
to implementation defined if I remember correctly (basically nobody implemented locale-dependent collation).
<p/>
So I guess the question is do we gain anything by requiring all character-comparisons to go through the locale when this bit 
is set? Certainly it adds a great deal to the implementation effort (it's not what Boost.Regex has ever done). I guess the 
question is are differing code-points that collate identically an important use case? I guess there might be a few Unicode 
code points that do that, but I don't know how to go about verifying that.
<p/>
STL:
<p/>
If this was unintentional, then 32.4.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.synopt">[re.synopt]</a>/1's table should be left alone, while 32.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.grammar">[re.grammar]</a>/14 
should be changed instead.
<p/>
Jeffrey Yasskin:
<p/>
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/tr18-13.html#Tailored_Loose_Matches">This page</a>
mentions that [V] in Swedish should match "W" in a perfect world.
<p/>
However, the most recent version of <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Tailored_Loose_Matches">TR18</a> retracts
both language-specific loose matches <em>and</em> language-specific ranges
because "for most full-featured regular expression engines, it is
quite difficult to match under code point equivalences that are not
1:1" and "tailored ranges can be quite difficult to implement
properly, and can have very unexpected results in practice. For
example, languages may also vary whether they consider lowercase below
uppercase or the reverse. This can have some surprising results: [a-Z]
may not match anything if <tt>Z &lt; a</tt> in that locale."
<p/>
<a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.10.2.15">ECMAScript</a> doesn't include collation at all.
<p/>
IMO, +1 to changing 28.13 instead of 28.5.1. It seems like we'd be on
fairly solid ground if we wanted to remove <tt>regex_constants::collate</tt>
entirely, in favor of named character classes, but of course that's
not for this issue.

32.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.traits">[re.traits]</a>/7, begins with "if <tt>typeid(use_facet&lt;collate&lt;charT&gt; &gt;) == typeid(collate_byname&lt;charT&gt;)</tt>", 
which appears to be pseudocode with the intention to convey that the collate facet has not been replaced by the user. Cf. the wording in 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2003/n1429.htm">N1429</a> "there is no portable way to implement 
<tt>transform_primary</tt> in terms of <tt>std::locale</tt>, since even if the sort key format returned by 
<tt>std::collate_byname&lt;&gt;::transform</tt> is known and can be converted into a primary sort key, the user can still 
install their own custom <tt>std::collate</tt> implementation into the locale object used, and that can use any sort key 
format they see fit.".
<p/>
Taken literally, 32.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.traits">[re.traits]</a>/7 appears to imply that named locales are required to hold their collate facets with 
dynamic type <tt>std::collate_byname&lt;charT&gt;</tt>, which is in fact true in some implementations (e.g libc++), but not others 
(e.g. libstdc++). This does not follow from the description of <tt>_byname</tt> in 30.3.1.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/locale.facet">[locale.facet]</a>/4, which is only 
required to provide equivalent semantics, to the named locale's facet, not to actually be one.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
For wide streams argument types <tt>wchar_t const*</tt> and <tt>wchar_t</tt> are supported only as template parameters. 
User defined conversions are not considered for template parameter matching. Hence inappropriate overloads of 
<tt>operator&lt;&lt;</tt> are selected when an implicit conversion is required for the argument, which is inconsistent 
with the behavior for <tt>char const*</tt> and <tt>char</tt>, is unexpected, and is a useless result.
<p/>
Demonstration:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct Byte_string
{ 
  operator char const*() const { return "Hurray, it works!"; } 
};

struct Wide_string
{ 
  operator wchar_t const*() const { return L"Hurray, it works!"; } 
};

struct Byte_ch
{ 
  operator char() const { return 'X'; } 
};

struct Wide_ch
{ 
  operator wchar_t() const { return L'X'; } 
};

auto main() -> int
{
  using namespace std;
  wcout &lt;&lt; "'X' as char value   : " &lt;&lt; Byte_ch() &lt;&lt; endl;
  wcout &lt;&lt; "'X' as wchar_t value: " &lt;&lt; Wide_ch() &lt;&lt; endl;
  wcout &lt;&lt; "Byte string pointer : " &lt;&lt; Byte_string() &lt;&lt; endl;
  wcout &lt;&lt; "Wide string pointer : " &lt;&lt; Wide_string() &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Example output:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
'X' as char value   : X
'X' as wchar_t value: 88
Byte string pointer : Hurray, it works!
Wide string pointer : 000803C8

Example: <tt>char16_t('1') != u'1'</tt> is possible.
<p/>
The numeric value of <tt>char16_t</tt> is defined to be Unicode
code point, which is same to the ASCII value and UTF-8 for
7-bit chars.  However, <tt>char</tt> is not guaranteed to have an
encoding which is compatible with ASCII. For example, <tt>'1'</tt> in EBCDIC is 241.
<p/>
I found three places in the standard casting narrow char
literals: <tt>bitset::bitset</tt>, <tt>bitset::to_string</tt> and <tt>quoted</tt>.
<p/>
PJ confirmed this issue and says he has a solution used
in their <tt>&lt;filesystem&gt;</tt> implementation, and he may want to
propose it to the standard.
<p/>
The solution in my mind, for now, is to make those default
arguments magical, where the "magic" can be implemented
with a C11 <tt>_Generic</tt> selection (works in clang):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#define _G(T, literal) _Generic(T{}, \
      char: literal, \
      wchar_t: L ## literal, \
      char16_t: u ## literal, \
      char32_t: U ## literal)

  _G(char16_t, '1') == u'1'

<p>
The 'Condition' for <tt>std::is_empty</tt> is listed as:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"<tt>T</tt> is a class type, but not a union type, with no non-static data members other than bit-fields of length 0, 
no virtual member functions, no virtual base classes, and no base class <tt>B</tt> for which <tt>is_empty&lt;B&gt;::value</tt> 
is false."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is incorrect: there is no such thing as a non-static data member that is a bit-field of length 0, since bit-fields of 
length 0 must be unnamed, and unnamed bit-fields are not members (see 11.4.10 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/class.bit">[class.bit]</a> p2).
<p/>
It also means that classes such as:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct S {
 int : 3;
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
are empty (because they have no non-static data members). There's implementation divergence on the value of 
<tt>is_empty&lt;S&gt;::value</tt>.
<p/>
I'm not sure what the purpose of <tt>is_empty</tt> is (or how it could be useful), but if it's desirable for the above type to 
not be treated as empty, something like this could work:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"<tt>T</tt> is a class type, but not a union type, with no non-static data members <del>other than</del><ins>, no unnamed</ins> 
bit-fields of <ins>non-zero</ins> length <del>0</del>, no virtual member functions, no virtual base classes, and no base class 
<tt>B</tt> for which <tt>is_empty&lt;B&gt;::value</tt> is false."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
and if the above type <em>should</em> be treated as empty, then this might be appropriate:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"<tt>T</tt> is a class type, but not a union type, with no <ins>(named)</ins> non-static data members <del>other than bit-fields of 
length 0</del>, no virtual member functions, no virtual base classes, and no base class <tt>B</tt> for which 
<tt>is_empty&lt;B&gt;::value</tt> is false."

<tt>a_uniq.emplace(args)</tt> is specified as:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Effects</i>: Inserts a value_type object <tt>t</tt> constructed with<br/>
<tt>std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...</tt> if and only if there is no element in the<br/>

the returned pair is true if and only if the insertion takes place,<br/>
and the iterator component of the pair points to the element with key<br/>
equivalent to the key of <tt>t</tt>. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>
However, we occasionally find code of the form:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
std::unique_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; p(new Foo);
auto res = m.emplace("foo", std::move(p));
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
where we'd like to avoid destroying the <tt>Foo</tt> if the insertion doesn't
take place (if the container already had an element with the specified key).
<p/>
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3873">N3873</a> includes
a partial solution to this in the form of a new <tt>emplace_stable</tt> member function, but LEWG's 
discussion strongly agreed that we'd rather have <tt>emplace()</tt> Just Work:
<p/>
Should <tt>map::emplace()</tt> be guaranteed not to move/copy its arguments if the insertion doesn't happen?
<p/>
SF: 8 F: 3 N: 0 A: 0 SA: 0
<p/>
This poll was marred by the fact that we didn't notice or call out
that <tt>emplace()</tt> must construct the key before doing the lookup, and it
must not then move the key after it determines whether an insert is
going to happen, and the <tt>mapped_type</tt> instance must live next to the key.
<p/>
The very similar issue <a href="2006">2006</a> was previously marked NAD, with
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3178.htm">N3178</a> as
discussion. However, given LEWG's interest in the alternate behavior,
we should reopen the question in this issue.
<p/>
We will need a paper that describes how to implement this before we can make more progress.

Given the following code,
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;sstream&gt;

std::stringbuf buf;
std::istreambuf_iterator&lt;char&gt; begin(&amp;buf);
std::istreambuf_iterator&lt;char&gt; end;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
it is not clear from the wording of the Standard whether <tt>begin.equal(end)</tt>
must be true. In at least one implementation it is not (CC: Sun C++ 5.10 SunOS_sparc Patch 128228-25 2013/02/20) and in at least
one implementation it is (gcc version 4.3.2 x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu).
<p/>
25.6.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/istreambuf.iterator">[istreambuf.iterator]</a> says that <tt>end</tt> is an end-of-stream iterator since it was default
constructed. It also says that an iterator becomes equal to an end-of-stream
iterator when end of stream is reached by <tt>sgetc()</tt> having returned <tt>eof()</tt>.
 [istreambuf.iterator::equal] says that <tt>equal()</tt> returns true iff both iterators are end of stream
or not end of stream. But there seems to be no requirement that <tt>equal</tt> check for end-of-stream by calling <tt>sgetc()</tt>. 
<p/>
Jiahan Zi at BloombergLP discovered this issue through his code failing to
work correctly. Dietmar K&uuml;hl has opined in a private communication that
the iterators should compare equal.
</p>

<p><i>[2023-03-31; Jonathan Wakely comments]</i></p>

<p>
I agree that they should compare equal, but that's in conflict with the
resolution of LWG <a href="2544">2544</a>, which says that <code>begin</code>
must not be at end-of-stream because <code>&amp;buf</code> is not null.

<p>
<tt>type_info</tt>'s destructor is depicted as being <tt>virtual</tt>, which is nearly unobservable to users (since they can't construct 
or copy this class, they can't usefully derive from it). However, it's technically observable (via <tt>is_polymorphic</tt> and 
<tt>has_virtual_destructor</tt>). It also imposes real costs on implementations, requiring them to store one vptr per 
<tt>type_info</tt> object, when RTTI space consumption is a significant concern.
<p/>
Making this implementation-defined wouldn't affect users (who can observe this only if they're specifically looking for it) and 
wouldn't affect implementations who need <tt>virtual</tt> here, but it would allow other implementations to drop <tt>virtual</tt> 
and improve their RTTI space consumption.
<p/>
Richard Smith:
<p/>
It's observable in a few other ways.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::map&lt;void*, something&gt; m;
m[dynamic_cast&lt;void*&gt;(&amp;typeid(blah))] = stuff;

<p>
... is broken by this change, because you can't <tt>dynamic_cast</tt> a non-polymorphic class type to <tt>void*</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>
type_info&amp; f();
typeid(f());
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
... evaluates <tt>f()</tt> at runtime without this change, and might not do so with this change.
<p/>
These are probably rare things, but I can imagine at least some forms of the latter being used in SFINAE tricks.

N3936 16.4.6.9 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/reentrancy">[reentrancy]</a>/1 talks about "functions", but that doesn't address the scenario of calling different member
functions of a single object. Member functions often have to violate and then re-establish invariants. For example, vectors
often have "holes" during insertion, and element constructors/destructors/etc. shouldn't be allowed to observe the vector
while it's in this invariant-violating state. The [reentrancy] Standardese should be extended to cover member functions,
so that implementers can either say that member function reentrancy is universally prohibited, or selectively allowed for
very specific scenarios.

<p>
The specification of <tt>std::align</tt> does not appear to specify what happens when the value of the <tt>size</tt> 
parameter is 0. (The question of what happens when <tt>alignment</tt> is 0 is mentioned in another Defect Report, <a href="2377">2377</a>; 
it would change the behavior to be undefined rather than potentially implementation-defined.)
<p/>
The case of <tt>size</tt> being 0 is interesting because the result is ambiguous. Consider the following code's output:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;

int main()
{
  alignas(8) char buffer[8];
  void *ptr = &amp;buffer[1];
  std::size_t space = sizeof(buffer) - sizeof(char[1]);

  void *result = std::align(8, 0, ptr, space);

  std::printf("%d %td\n", !!result, result ? (static_cast&lt;char*&gt;(result) - buffer) : std::ptrdiff_t(-1));
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are four straightforward answers as to what the behavior of <tt>std::align</tt> with size 0 should be:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The behavior is undefined because the size is invalid.</p></li>
<li><p>The behavior is implementation-defined. This seems to be the status quo, with current implementations using #3.</p></li>

The <tt>BaseCharacteristic</tt> for <tt>is_constructible</tt> is defined in terms of the well-formedness 
of a declaration for an invented variable. The well-formedness of the described declaration itself may 
change for the same set of arguments because of the introduction of default arguments.
<p/>
In the following program, there appears to be conflicting definitions of a specialization of 
<tt>std::is_constructible</tt>; however, it seems that this situation is caused without a user violation 
of the library requirements or the ODR. There is a similar issue with <tt>is_convertible</tt>, <tt>result_of</tt>
and others.
<p/>
a.cc:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>

Presumably this program should invoke undefined behaviour, but the Library specification doesn't

<p>
When resizing a <tt>vector</tt>, the accessibility and exception specification of the value type's 
constructors determines whether the elements are copied or moved to the new buffer.
However, the copy/move is performed via the allocator's <tt>construct</tt> member function, which is 
assumed, but not required, to call the copy/move constructor and propagate only exceptions 
from the value type's copy/move constructor. The issue might also affect other classes. 
<p/>
The current wording in N4296 relevant here is from Table 28 &mdash; "Allocator requirements" in 
16.4.4.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/allocator.requirements">[allocator.requirements]</a>: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<table border="1">

</table>
</blockquote>
<p>
and from 16.4.4.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/allocator.requirements">[allocator.requirements]</a> p9:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
An allocator may constrain the types on which it can be instantiated and the arguments for which its
<tt>construct</tt> member may be called. If a type cannot be used with a particular allocator, the allocator class
or the call to <tt>construct</tt> may fail to instantiate.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I conclude the following from the wording:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The allocator is not required to call the copy constructor if the
arguments (args) is a single (potentially const) lvalue of the value
type. Similarly for a non-const rvalue + move constructor. See also
24.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a> p15 which seems to try to require
this, but is not sufficient:
That paragraph specifies the semantics of the allocator's operations,
but not which constructors of the value type are used, if any.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>The allocator may throw exceptions in addition to the exceptions propagated by
the constructors of the value type; it can also propagate exceptions from constructors
other than a copy/move constructor.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This leads to an issue with the wording of the exception safety guarantees for vector modifiers in
24.3.11.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/vector.modifiers">[vector.modifiers]</a> p1:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[&hellip;]
</p>
<pre>
void push_back(const T&amp; x);
void push_back(T&amp;&amp; x);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Remarks</i>: Causes reallocation if the new size is greater than the old capacity. If no 
reallocation happens, all the iterators and references before the insertion point remain valid. 
If an exception is thrown other than by the copy constructor, move constructor, assignment 
operator, or move assignment operator of <tt>T</tt> or by any InputIterator operation there are 
no effects.
<span  style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bold">
If an exception is thrown while inserting a single element at the end and <tt>T</tt> 
is <tt>CopyInsertable</tt> or <tt>is_nothrow_move_constructible&lt;T&gt;::value</tt>
is true, there are no effects. Otherwise, if an exception is thrown by the move constructor of a
non-<tt>CopyInsertable</tt> <tt>T</tt>, the effects are unspecified.
</span>
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
The wording leads to the following problem:
Copy and move assignment are invoked directly from <tt>vector</tt>.
For intermediary objects (see <a href="2164">2164</a>),
<tt>vector</tt> also directly invokes the copy and move constructor of the value type.
However, construction of the actual element within the buffer is invoked via the allocator abstraction.
As discussed above, the allocator currently is not required to call a copy/move constructor.
If <tt>is_nothrow_move_constructible&lt;T&gt;::value</tt> is <tt>true</tt> for some value type <tt>T</tt>,
but the allocator uses modifying operations for <tt>MoveInsertion</tt> that do throw,
the implementation is required to ensure that "there are no effects",
even if the source buffer has been modified.
<p/>
Similarly, the <tt>vector</tt> capacity functions specify exception safety guarantees
referring to the move constructor of the value type. For example, <tt>vector::resize</tt> in 24.3.11.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/vector.capacity">[vector.capacity]</a> p14:
</p>
<blockquote>
<i>Remarks</i>: If an exception is thrown other than by the move constructor of a
non-<tt>CopyInsertable</tt> <tt>T</tt> there are no effects.
</blockquote>
<p>
The wording leads to the same issue as described above.
<p/>
Code example:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class T&gt;
class allocator;

class pot_reg_type // a type which creates
                   // potentially registered instances

  struct register_t {};

private:
  pot_reg_type(register_t                     ) noexcept(false)
  { enregister(); }
  pot_reg_type(register_t, pot_reg_type const&amp;) noexcept(false)
  { enregister(); }
  pot_reg_type(register_t, pot_reg_type&amp;&amp;     ) noexcept(false)
  { enregister(); }
};

template&lt;class T&gt;
class allocator
{
public:
  using value_type = T;

  value_type* allocate(std::size_t p)
  { return (value_type*) ::operator new(p); }

  template&lt;class... Args&gt;
  void construct(T* p, Args&amp;&amp;... args)
  {
    new((void*)p) T(std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...);
  }
}; 
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <tt>construct</tt> member function template is only required for rebinding,
which can be required e.g. to store additional debug information in
the allocated memory (e.g. VS2013).
<p/>
Even though the value type has an accessible and <tt>noexcept(true)</tt> move
constructor, this allocator won't call that constructor for rvalue arguments.
In any case, it does not call a constructor for which vector has formulated its 
requirements. An exception thrown by a constructor called by this allocator is not
covered by the specification in 24.3.11.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/vector.modifiers">[vector.modifiers]</a> and therefore is
guaranteed not to have any effect on the vector object when resizing.
<p/>
For an example how this might invalidate the exception safety
guarantees, see <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/d/topic/std-discussion/BcM7ya8JeqY/discussion">this post on the std-discussion mailing list</a>.
<p/>
Another problem arises for value types whose constructors are private,
but may be called by the allocator e.g. via friendship.
Those value types are not <tt>MoveConstructible</tt> 
(<tt>is_move_constructible</tt> is false), yet they can be <tt>MoveInsertable</tt>.
It is not possible for <tt>vector</tt> to create intermediary objects (see <a href="2164">2164</a>) of such a type
by directly using the move constructor.
Current implementations of the single-element forms of <tt>vector::insert</tt> and <tt>vector::emplace</tt>
do create intermediary objects by directly calling one of the value type's constructors,
probably to allow inserting objects from references that alias other elements of the container.
As far as I can see, Table 100 &mdash; "Sequence container requirements" in 24.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/sequence.reqmts">[sequence.reqmts]</a>
does not require that the creation of such intermediare objects can be performed
by containers using the value type's constructor directly.
It is unclear to me if the allocator's construct function could be used to create those
intermediary objects, given that they have not been allocated by the allocator.
<p/>
Two possible solutions:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Add the following requirement to the <tt>allocator_traits::construct</tt> function:
If the parameter pack <tt>args</tt> consists of a single parameter of the type
<tt>value_type&amp;&amp;</tt>,
the function may only propagate exceptions if <tt>is_nothrow_move_constructible&lt;value_type&gt;::value</tt>
is <tt>false</tt>.
<p/>
Requiring <tt>alloctor_traits::construct</tt> to call a true copy/move constructor
of the value type breaks <tt>std::scoped_allocator_adapter</tt>,
as pointed out by <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/d/msg/std-discussion/0yxikZInp-E/Lxj-msFT22cJ">Casey Carter in a post on the std-discussion mailing list</a>.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
Change vector's criterion whether to move or copy when resizing:
<p/>
Instead of testing the value type's constructors via
<tt>is_move_constructible</tt>, check the value of
<tt>noexcept( allocator_traits&lt;Allocator&gt;::construct(alloc, ptr, rval) )</tt>
where
<tt>alloc</tt> is an lvalue of type <tt>Allocator</tt>,
<tt>ptr</tt> is an expression of type <tt>allocator_traits&lt;Allocator&gt;::pointer</tt>
and
<tt>rval</tt> is a non-const rvalue of type <tt>value_type</tt>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
A short discussion of the two solutions:
<p/>
Solution 1 allows keeping <tt>is_nothrow_move_constructible&lt;value_type&gt;</tt>
as the criterion for <tt>vector</tt> to decide between copying and moving when resizing.
It restricts what can be done inside the <tt>construct</tt> member function of allocators,
and requires implementers of allocators to pay attention to the value types used.
One could conceive allocators checking the following with a <tt>static_assert</tt>:
If the value type <tt>is_nothrow_move_constructible</tt>,
then the constructor actually called for <tt>MoveInsertion</tt> within the <tt>construct</tt>
member function is also declared as noexcept.
<p/>
Solution 2 requires changing both the implementation of the default
allocator (add a conditional <tt>noexcept</tt>) and <tt>vector</tt> (replace
<tt>is_move_constructible</tt> with an allocator-targeted check).
It does not impose additional restrictions on the allocator (other than
24.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a> p15),
and works nicely even if the move constructor of a <tt>MoveInsertable</tt> type is private or deleted
(the allocator might be a friend of the value type).
<p/>
In both cases, an addition might be required to provide the basic exception safety guarantee.
A short discussion on this topic can be found
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/d/topic/std-discussion/yZLnYy_y2z0/discussion">
in the std-discussion mailing list</a>.
Essentially, if <tt>allocator_traits&lt;Allocator&gt;::construct</tt> throws an exception,
the object may or may not have been constructed.
Two solutions are mentioned in that discussion:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
<tt>allocator_traits&lt;Allocator&gt;::construct</tt> needs to tell its caller
whether or not the construction was successful, in case of an exception.
</p></li>
<li><p>
If <tt>allocator_traits&lt;Allocator&gt;::construct</tt> propagates an exception,
it shall either not have constructed an object at the specified location,
or that object shall have been destroyed
(or it shall ensure otherwise that no resources are leaked).

<p><i>[2015-05-23, Tomasz Kami&nacute;ski comments]</i></p>

<p>
Solution 1 discussed in this issue also breaks support for the <tt>polymorphic_allocator</tt> proposed in the part 
of the Library Fundamentals TS v1, in addition to already mentioned <tt>std::scoped_allocator_adapter</tt>. Furthermore 
there is unknown impact on the other user-defined state-full allocators code written in the C++11.
<p/>
In addition the library resolution proposed in the LWG issues <a href="2089">2089</a> and 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4462.html">N4462</a>, 
will break the relation between the <tt>std::allocator_trait::construct</tt> method and 
copy/move constructor even for the standard <tt>std::allocator</tt>. As example please consider following class:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct NonCopyable
{
  NonCopyable() = default;
  NonCopyable(NonCopyable const&amp;) = delete;
  NonCopyable(NonCopyable&amp;&amp;) = delete;
};

struct InitListConstructor : NonCopyable
{
  InitListConstructor() = default;
  InitListConstructor(std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt;);
  operator int() const;
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
For the above declarations following expression are ill-formed:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
InitListConstructor copy(std::declval&lt;InitListConstructor const&amp;&gt;());
InitListConstructor move(std::declval&lt;InitListConstructor&amp;&amp;&gt;());
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
So the class is not <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> nor <tt>MoveConstructible</tt>. However the following are well formed:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
InitListConstructor copy{std::declval&lt;InitListConstructor const&amp;&gt;()};
InitListConstructor move{std::declval&lt;InitListConstructor&amp;&amp;&gt;()};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
And will be used by <tt>std::allocator&lt;InitListConstructor&gt;::construct</tt> in case of move-insertion 
and copy-insertion, after appliance of the resolution proposed in mentioned papers:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The gist of the proposed library fix is simple:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if <tt>is_constructible_v&lt;TargetType, Args...&gt;</tt>, use direct-nonlist-initialization</p></li>
<li><p>otherwise, use brace-initialization.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
As consequence the requirement proposed in the Solution 1:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If the parameter pack <tt>args</tt> consists of a single parameter of the type <tt>value_type&amp;&amp;</tt>, 
the function may only propagate exceptions if <tt>is_nothrow_move_constructible&lt;value_type&gt;::value</tt> is false. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Will no longer hold for the <tt>std::allocator</tt>.

<p>
It's unspecified how many times <tt>copy_n</tt> increments the <tt>InputIterator</tt>.
<tt>uninitialized_copy_n</tt> is specified to increment it exactly <tt>n</tt> times,
which means if an <tt>istream_iterator</tt> is used then the next character
after those copied is read from the stream and then discarded, losing data.
<p/>
I believe all three of Dinkumware, libc++ and libstdc++ implement
<tt>copy_n</tt> with <tt>n - 1</tt> increments of the <tt>InputIterator</tt>, which avoids reading
and discarding a character when used with <tt>istream_iterator</tt>, but is
inconsistent with <tt>uninitialized_copy_n</tt> and causes surprising behaviour
with <tt>istreambuf_iterator</tt> instead, because <tt>copy_n(in, 2, copy_n(in, 2,
out))</tt> is not equivalent to <tt>copy_n(in, 4, out)</tt>
</p>

<p>Tues PM: refer to LEWG</p>

<p><i>[LEWG Kona 2017]</i></p>

<p>This is a mess. Append to Effects: If the InputIterator is not a forward iterator, increments n-1 times. Otherwise the number of increments is not more than n. (ncm) The preceding proposition is unsatisfactory, because it is wrong for istreambuf_iterator, which is much more useful than istream_iterator. Proposing instead: Append to Effects: If InputIterator is istream_iterator for some T, increments n-1 times. Otherwise, increments n times. Want a paper exploring what the implementations actually do, and what non-uniformity is "right".</p>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The standard library specifies a lot of heterogeneous comparison operators. For instance:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class... TTypes, class... UTypes&gt;
constexpr bool operator!=(const tuple&lt;TTypes...&gt;&amp;, const tuple&lt;UTypes...&gt;&amp;);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This has an unfortunate consequence:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
#include &lt;tuple&gt;
#include &lt;utility&gt;

using namespace std::rel_ops;
std::tuple&lt;int&gt; a(0);
bool b = a != a;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The last line here is ill-formed due to ambiguity: it might be <tt>rel_ops::operator!=</tt>, and it might be the
heterogeneous tuple <tt>operator!=</tt>. These are not partially ordered, because they have different constraints:
<tt>rel_ops</tt> requires the types to match, whereas the tuple comparison requires both types to be tuples (but not
to match). The same thing happens for user code that defines its own unconstrained
'<tt>template&lt;typename T&gt; operator!=(const T&amp;, const T&amp;)</tt>' rather than using <tt>rel_ops</tt>.
<p/>
One straightforward fix would be to add a homogeneous overload for each heterogeneous comparison:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class... TTypes&gt;
constexpr bool operator!=(const tuple&lt;TTypes...&gt;&amp;, const tuple&lt;TTypes...&gt;&amp;);
</pre>
<p>
This is then unambiguously chosen over the other options in the preceding case. FWIW, libstdc++ already does this
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.6.4/libstdc++/api/a01065_source.html#l00788">in some cases</a>.

How does <tt>wbuffer_convert</tt> use the <tt>cvtstate</tt> member?
<p/>
Is the same conversion state object used for converting both the get

through a multibyte character will leave some shift state in cvtstate, 
which would then be used by a following write, even though the shift 
state of the get area is unrelated to the put area.

<p>
Paragraph 4 of D.27.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/depr.conversions.string">[depr.conversions.string]</a> introduces <tt>byte_err_string</tt> 
as "a byte string to display on errors". What does display mean? The string is returned 
on error, it's not displayed anywhere.
<p/>
Paragraph 14 says "Otherwise, if the object was constructed with a
byte-error string, the member function shall return the byte-error
string." The term byte-error string is not used anywhere else.
<p/>
Paragraph 17 talks about storing "default values in <tt>byte_err_string</tt>".
What default value? Is "Hello, world!" allowed? If it means
default-construction it should say so. If paragraph 14 says it won't
be used what does it matter how it's initialized? The end of the
paragraph refers to storing "<tt>byte_err</tt> in <tt>byte_err_string</tt>". This should
be more clearly related to the wording in paragraph 14.
<p/>
It might help if the constructor (and destructor) was specified before
the other member functions, so it can more formally define the
difference between being "constructed with a byte-error string" and
not.
<p/>
All the same issues apply to the <tt>wide_err_string</tt> member.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
It is not entirely clear if and when the specializations of <tt>std::less</tt> (and friends) for pointer types 
can be used in a constant expression. Consider the following code:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;functional&gt;

struct foo {};
foo x, y;
constexpr bool b = std::less&lt;foo*&gt;{}(&amp;x, &amp;y); // [1]

foo z[] = {{}, {}};
constexpr bool ba = std::less&lt;foo*&gt;{}(&amp;z[0], &amp;z[1]); // [2]
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Comparing the address of unrelated objects is not a constant expression since the result is unspecified, so 
it could be expected for [1] to fail and [2] to succeed. However, <tt>std::less</tt> specialization for pointer 
types is well-defined and yields a total order, so it could just as well be expected for [1] to succeed. Finally, 
since the implementation of such specializations is not mandated, [2] could fail as well (This could happen, if
an implementation would provide such a specialization and if that would use built-in functions that would not be
allowed in constant expressions, for example). In any case, the standard should be clear so as to avoid 
implementation-defined <tt>constexpr</tt>-ness.
</p>

<p><i>[2017-01-22, Jens provides rationale and proposed wording]</i></p>

<p>
<tt>std::less&lt;T*&gt;</tt> is required to deliver a total order on pointers.
However, the layout of global objects is typically determined
by the linker, not the compiler, so requiring <tt>std::less&lt;T*&gt;</tt> to
provide an ordering at compile-time that is consistent with
run-time would need results from linking to feed back to
the compiler, something that C++ has traditionally not required.

<p><i>[2021-04-05; Jiang An comments and provides alternative wording]</i></p>

<p>
The libc++ and MSVC STL implementations only support flat address spaces, and always use comparison operators. 
The libstdc++ implementation casts pointer values to <tt>uintptr_t</tt> if the direct comparison result is unusable 
in constant evaluation.
<p/>
So, I think that we can specify that the implementation-defined strict total order (3.27 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/defns.order.ptr">[defns.order.ptr]</a>) 
generates a core constant expression if and only if the corresponding underlying comparison expression comparing 
pointer values is a core constant expression. No any other case should be a core constant expression, otherwise 
we should also make the underlying comparison expression a core constant expression.
<p/>
IMO the proposed resolution is already implemented in libc++, libstdc++, and MSVC STL, and implementable on compilers 
that either support flat address spaces only or have implemented intrinsics needed for transparent comparison operators 
and <tt>std::is_constant_evaluated</tt>.

<p>
The typical use-case of <tt>std::initializer_list&lt;T&gt;</tt> is for a pass-by-value parameter of <tt>T</tt>'s constructor. 
However, this contravenes 16.4.5.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/res.on.functions">[res.on.functions]</a>/2.5 because <tt>initializer_list</tt> doesn't specifically allow 
incomplete types (as do for example <tt>std::unique_ptr</tt> (20.3.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unique.ptr">[unique.ptr]</a>/5) and 
<tt>std::enable_shared_from_this</tt> (20.3.2.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.enab">[util.smartptr.enab]</a>/2)).
<p/>
A resolution would be to copy-paste the relevant text from such a paragraph.

<p>
I do not believe that the wording in 21.3.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/meta.unary.prop">[meta.unary.prop]</a> paragraph 3 allows for the following program to be ill-formed:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
#include &lt;type_traits&gt;

template &lt;typename T&gt; struct B : T { };
template &lt;typename T&gt; struct A { A&amp; operator=(const B&lt;T&gt;&amp;); };

std::is_assignable&lt;A&lt;int&gt;, int&gt; q;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In particular, I do not see where the wording allows for the "compilation of the expression" 
<tt>declval&lt;T&gt;() = declval&lt;U&gt;()</tt> to occur as a consequence of instantiating <tt>std::is_assignable&lt;T, U&gt;</tt> 
(where <tt>T</tt> and <tt>U</tt> are, respectively, <tt>A&lt;int&gt;</tt> and <tt>int</tt> in the example code).
<p/>
Instantiating <tt>A&lt;int&gt;</tt> as a result of requiring it to be a complete type does not trigger the instantiation of 
<tt>B&lt;int&gt;</tt>; however, the "compilation of the expression" in question does.

<p>
This needs to be changed, for example to use <tt>std::uncaught_exceptions()</tt> and to capture the value on entry and

The class template <tt>basic_streambuf&lt;charT, traits&gt;</tt> serves as an abstract base class for deriving various

</p></blockquote>
<p>
The term "abstract base class" is not defined in the standard, but "abstract class" is (11.7.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/class.abstract">[class.abstract]</a>).
<p/>
According to the synopsis <tt>basic_streambuf</tt> has no pure virtual
functions so is not an abstract class and none of libstdc++, libc++, or
dinkumware implement it as an abstract class. I don't believe the wording was
ever intended to require it to be an abstract class, but it could be
read that way.
<p/>
I suggest the wording be changed to "polymorphic base class" or
something else that can't be seen to imply a normative requirement to
make it an abstract class.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The concurrency libraries specified in clauses 29 and 30 do not adequately specify how they relate to the concurrency model 
specified in 6.9.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.multithread">[intro.multithread]</a>. In particular:
<p/>
6.9.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.multithread">[intro.multithread]</a> specifies "atomic objects" as having certain properties. I can only assume that instances 
of the classes defined in Clause 29 are intended to be "atomic objects" in this sense, but I can't find any wording to 
specify that, and it's genuinely unclear whether Clause 30 objects are atomic objects. In fact, on a literal reading the 
C++ Standard doesn't appear to provide <em>any</em> portable way to create an atomic object, or even determine whether an 
object is an atomic object.
<p/>
(It's not clear if the term "atomic object" is actually needed, given that atomic objects can have non-atomic operations, 
and non-atomic objects can have atomic operations. But even if the term itself goes away, there still needs to be some 
indication that Clause 29 objects have the properties currently attributed to atomic objects).
<p/>
Similarly, 6.9.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.multithread">[intro.multithread]</a> uses "atomic operation" as a term of art, but the standard never unambiguously 
identifies any operation as an "atomic operation" (although in one case it unambiguously identifies an operation that is 
<em>not</em> atomic). It does come close in a few cases, but not close enough:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>6.9.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.multithread">[intro.multithread]</a>/p7 could be read to imply that "synchronization operations" in Clauses 29 and 30 
are also atomic operations. However, that's vague and indirect, and somewhat belied by 33.6.4.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.mutex.requirements.mutex">[thread.mutex.requirements.mutex]</a>/p5, 
which specifies that mutex lock and unlock operations "behave as atomic operations", but only "for purposes of determining 
the existence of a data race". Furthermore, not a single operation in Clause 29 explicitly identifies itself as a 
"synchronization operation".</p></li>
<li><p>33.5.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.types.generic">[atomics.types.generic]</a>/p4 states in part that "There shall be a specialization <tt>atomic&lt;bool&gt;</tt> 
which provides the general atomic operations as specified in 29.6.1", but read in context, "general atomic operations" 
appears to be a loose synonym for "general operations on atomic types" as defined in  [atomics.types.operations.general], 
rather than a use of "atomic object" as Words of Power. Incidentally, "atomic type" is never satisfactorily defined either 
(although the <tt>&lt;atomic&gt;</tt> synopsis comes close).</p></li>
<li><p>17.13 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/support.runtime">[support.runtime]</a>/p10 specifies exactly which operations are "plain lock-free atomic operations", but 
in a standard where an "integral constant expression" isn't necessarily a "constant expression", I do not feel safe assuming 
that a "plain lock-free atomic operation" is an "atomic operation".</p></li>
<li><p>Hans Boehm tells me the operations with "atomically" in the Effects element are intended to be atomic operations, 
but since "atomic operation" is a term of art (e.g. in 6.9.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.multithread">[intro.multithread]</a>/p27.4), I think this needs to be 
spelled out rather than assumed. Furthermore, this does not help with 33.5.11 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.fences">[atomics.fences]</a>, or anything in Clause 30.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><i>[2018-03 JAX; Geoffrey comments in behalf of SG1]</i></p>

<p>
SG1 consensus is that operations outside clause 32 are not "atomic operations", and objects of types defined outside clause 32 are not "atomic objects". "Synchronization operations" are operations which act as endpoints of primitive edges of partial orders other than sequenced-before, but it may make more sense to just drop that term and inline the definition, so to speak.
<p/>
We would welcome a paper to make those definitions more explicit, and revise the wording as needed to be consistent with those definitions.

<p>
The enumeration type <tt>codecvt_mode</tt> is effectively a bitmask type
(16.3.3.3.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/bitmask.types">[bitmask.types]</a>) with three elements, but isn't defined as
such.
<p/>
This harms usability because bitmask types are required to work well
with bitwise operators, but <tt>codecvt_mode</tt> doesn't have overloaded
operators, making it very inconvenient to combine values:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::codecvt_utf16&lt;char32_t, 0x10FFFF,
  static_cast&lt;std::codecvt_mode&gt;(std::little_endian|std::generate_header)&gt;
cvt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The <tt>static_cast</tt> harms readability and should not be necessary.
<p/>
I suggest that either <tt>codecvt_mode</tt> is specified to be a bitmask type,
or as a minimal fix we provide an overloaded <tt>operator|</tt> that returns
the right type.

17.6.3.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/new.delete.dataraces">[new.delete.dataraces]</a> uses obsolete wording.
<p/>
It should introduce a "synchronizes with" relationship. "Happens before" is too weak, since that may not composes 
with sequenced before.
<p/>
The "shall not introduce a data race" wording is probably not technically correct either. These may race with other 
(non-allocation/deallocation) concurrent accesses to the object being allocated or deallocated.

I recently encountered a failure related to questionable use of <tt>do_get_year</tt>. The platform where the code happened 
to work had an implementation which handled certain three-digit "year identifiers" as the number of years since 
1900 (<a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/remembering-y2k/228701726">this article</a> describes such an implementation).
<p/>
30.4.6.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/locale.time.get.virtuals">[locale.time.get.virtuals]</a> makes it implementation defined whether two-digit years are accepted, etc., but does not 
say anything specifically about three-digit years.
<p/>
The implementation freedom to not report errors in 30.4.6.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/locale.time.get">[locale.time.get]</a> paragraph 1 also seems to be too broad.

<p>
The allocator-aware container requirements in Table 98 impose no
<tt>MoveAssignable</tt> requirements on the <tt>value_type</tt> when
<tt>propagate_on_container_move_assignment</tt> is true, because typically the
container's storage would be moved by just exchanging some pointers.
<p/>
However for a <tt>basic_string</tt> using the small string optimization move
assignment may need to assign individual characters into the small
string buffer, even when the allocator propagates.
<p/>
The only requirement on the char-like objects stored in a <tt>basic_string</tt>
are that they are non-array POD types and <tt>Destructible</tt>, which means
that a POD type with a deleted move assignment operator should be
usable in a <tt>basic_string</tt>, despite it being impossible to move assign:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;string&gt;

struct odd_pod 
{
  odd_pod() = default;
  odd_pod&amp; operator=(odd_pod&amp;&amp;) = delete;
};

static_assert(std::is_pod&lt;odd_pod&gt;::value, "POD");

int main()
{
  using S = std::basic_string&lt;odd_pod&gt;;
  S s;
  s = S{};       // fails
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Using libstdc++ <tt>basic_string&lt;odd_pod&gt;</tt> cannot even be
default-constructed because the constructor attempts to assign the
null terminator to the first element of the small string buffer.
<p/>
Similar problems exist with POD types with a deleted default constructor.
<p/>
I believe that <tt>basic_string</tt> should require its <tt>value_type</tt> to be at
least <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt> and <tt>MoveAssignable</tt>.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The <tt>std::tuple</tt> order of element construction is unspecified. It is either in the same order of the type list or in reverse. 
<p/>
Consider the following program:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;tuple&gt;

struct X 
{
  X(int) { std::cout &lt;&lt; "X constructor\n"; }
};

struct Y 
{
  Y(int) { std::cout &lt;&lt; "Y constructor\n"; }
};

int main()
{
  std::tuple&lt;X, Y&gt; t(1, 2);
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Here is a <a href="http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/764d0477523ba249">link</a> to two sample compilations. The first uses 
libstdc++ and constructs in reverse order, and the second uses libc++ and constructs in in-order. 
<p/>
A <tt>std::tuple</tt> mimics both a struct and type-generic container and should thus follow their standards. Construction is 
fundamentally different from a function call, and it has been historically important for a specific order to be guaranteed; 
namely: whichever the developer may decide. Mandating construction order will allow developers to reference younger elements 
later on in the chain as well, much like a struct allows you to do with its members.
<p/>
There are implementation issues as well. Reversed lists will require unnecessary overhead for braced-initializer-list initialization.  
Since lists are evaluated from left to right, the initializers must be placed onto the stack to respect the construction order. 
This issue could be significant for large tuples, deeply nested tuples, or tuples with elements that require 
many constructor arguments.
<p/>
I propose that the <tt>std::tuple&lt;A, B, ..., Y, Z&gt;</tt>'s constructor implementation be standardized, and made to construct 
in the same order as its type list e.g. <tt>A{}, B{}, ..., Y{}, Z{}</tt>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Daniel:</b>
<p/>
When <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3140.html">N3140</a> became accepted, wording had been
added that gives at least an indication of requiring element initialization in the order of the declaration of the template
parameters. This argumentation can be based on 22.4.4.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/tuple.cnstr">[tuple.cnstr]</a> p3 (emphasize mine):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
-3- In the constructor descriptions that follow, let <tt><i>i</i></tt> be in the range <tt>[0,sizeof...(Types))</tt> 
<span style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bold">in order</span>, 
<tt><i>Ti</i></tt> be the <tt><i>i<sup>th</sup></i></tt> type in <tt>Types</tt>, and <tt><i>Ui</i></tt> be the 
<tt><i>i<sup>th</sup></i></tt> type in a template parameter pack named <tt>UTypes</tt>, where indexing is
zero-based.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But the current wording needs to be improved to make that intention clearer and an issue like this one is necessary to be sure that
the committee is agreeing (or disagreeing) with that intention, especially because N3140 didn't really point out the relevance of the element
construction order in the discussion, and because not all constructors explicitly refer to the ordered sequence of numbers generated
by the variable <tt><i>i</i></tt> (The move constructor does it right, but most other don't do that). 
</p>

<p><i>[2017-02-12, Alisdair comments]</i></p>

<p>
Note that this issue should not be extended to cover the assignment operators,
as implementations may want the freedom to re-order member-wise assignment
so that, for example, all potentially-throwing assignments are performed before
non-throwing assignments (as indicated by the <tt>noexcept</tt> operator).

<p>
When a shared-state is released, it may be necessary to execute user defined code for the destructor of a 
stored value or exception. It is unclear whether the execution of said destructor constitutes an observable side effect.
</p>
<p>
While discussing N4445 in Lenexa, Nat Goodspeed pointed out that 33.10.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/futures.state">[futures.state]</a>/5.1 does not explicitly 
mention the destruction of the result, so implementations should be allowed to release (or reuse) a shared state ahead 
of time under the "as-if" rule.
<p/>
The standard should clarify whether the execution of destructors is a visible side effect of releasing a shared state.

<tt>promise::set_value_at_thread_exit</tt> and <tt>promise::set_exception_at_thread_exit</tt> operate on a shared state 
at thread exit, without making the thread participate in the ownership of such shared state.
<p/>
Consider the following snippet:

<p>
Arguably, since the <tt>promise</tt> abandons its shared state without actually making it ready, a <tt>broken_promise</tt>

<p>
In <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4538.pdf">N4538</a>, the continuation given to
<tt>future::then</tt> can be run "on an unspecified thread of execution". This is too broad, as it allows the
continuation to be run on the main thread, a UI thread, or any other thread. In comparison, functions given to
<tt>async</tt> run "as if in a new thread of execution", while the Parallelism TS gives less guarantees by running
"in either the invoking thread or in a thread implicitly created by the library to support parallel algorithm execution".
The threads on which the continuation given to <tt>future::then</tt> can run should be similarly constrained.
</p>

<p><i>[2017-03-01, Kona, SG1]</i></p>

<p>
Agreement that this is a problem. Suggested addition to the issue is below. We have no immediate delivery vehicle
for a fix at the moment, but we would like to make the intended direction clear.
<p/>
There is SG1 consensus that <tt>.then</tt> continuations should, by default, and in the absence of executors, be run
only in the following ways:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If the future is not ready when <tt>.then()</tt> is called, the <tt>.then</tt> argument may be run on the execution
agent that fulfills the promise.</p></li>
<li><p>In all cases, the <tt>.then</tt> argument may be run on an implementation-provided thread, i.e. a thread that is
neither the main thread nor explicitly created by the user.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
In the absence of an executor argument (which currently cannot be supplied), running of the <tt>.then()</tt> continuation
will not block the thread calling <tt>.then()</tt>, even if the future is ready at the time.
<p/>
Straw polls:
<p/>
SF | F | N | A | SA
<p/>
For the default behaviour:
<p/>
"1. Run on completed task or new execution agent"
<p/>
0 | 7 | 5 | 1 | 0
<p/>
"2. Run on completed task or <tt>.then</tt> caller"
<p/>
0 | 0 | 5 | 5 | 3
<p/>
"3. Leave as implementation defined"
<p/>
1 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 3
<p/>
"4. Always new execution agent"
<p/>
2 | 3 | 6 | 2 | 0
<p/>
The actual conclusion was to allow either (1) or (4) for now, since they are quite close, but present a very different
programming mode from (2).

In 32.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.grammar">[re.grammar]</a> paragraph 2:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<tt>basic_regex</tt> member functions shall not call any locale dependent C or C++ API, including the formatted

</p></blockquote>
<p>
Yet, the required interface for a regular expression traits class (32.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.req">[re.req]</a>) does not appear to have 
any reliable method for determining whether a character as encoded for the locale associated with the traits 
instance is the same as a character represented by a <em>UnicodeEscapeSequence</em>, e.g., assuming a sane 
<tt>ru_RU.koi8r</tt> locale:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;regex&gt;

const char data[] = "\xB3";
const char matchCyrillicCaptialLetterYo[] = R"(\u0401)";

int main(void) 
{
  try {
    std::regex myRegex;
    myRegex.imbue(std::locale("ru_RU.koi8r"));

    myRegex.assign(matchCyrillicCaptialLetterYo, std::regex_constants::ECMAScript);
    printf("(%s)\n", std::regex_replace(std::string(data), myRegex, std::string("E")).c_str());

    myRegex.assign("[[:alpha:]]", std::regex_constants::ECMAScript);

  } catch (std::regex_error&amp; e) {

}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The implementation I tried prints:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>

<p>
Which means that the character class matching worked, but not the matching to the <em>UnicodeEscapeSequence</em>.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
A number of places in the library, including 22.10.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/comparisons">[comparisons]</a>/14, the Optional container requirements in 
24.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a>, and 33.4.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.thread.id">[thread.thread.id]</a>/8, use the phrase "total order". 
Unfortunately, that phrase is ambiguous. In mathematics, the most common definition is that a relation <tt>&le;</tt> is 
a total order if it's total, transitive, and antisymmetric in the sense that <tt>x&le;y &#x2227; y&le;x &rArr; x=y</tt>. 
What we really want is a strict total order: a relation <tt>&lt;</tt> is a strict total order if it's total, transitive, and 
antisymmetric in the sense that exactly one of <tt>x&lt;y</tt>, <tt>y&lt;x</tt>, and <tt>x=y</tt> holds.
</p>
<p>
The non-normative note in 27.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/alg.sorting">[alg.sorting]</a>/4 correctly uses the phrase "strict total ordering" rather than 
simply "total ordering".
</p>
<p>
We could address this issue by replacing "total order" with "strict total order" everywhere it appears, since I 
think there are no cases where we actually want a non-strict total order, or we could add something in Clause 17 saying 
that we always mean strict total order whenever we say total order.

Currently 29.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.syn">[time.syn]</a> states
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<i>// convenience typedefs</i>
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 64 bits</i>,        nano&gt; nanoseconds;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 55 bits</i>,       micro&gt; microseconds;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 45 bits</i>,       milli&gt; milliseconds;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 35 bits</i>             &gt; seconds;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 29 bits</i>, ratio&lt;  60&gt;&gt; minutes;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 23 bits</i>, ratio&lt;3600&gt;&gt; hours;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
However, a <tt>duration_cast&lt;minutes&gt;(seconds::max())</tt> would cause overflow if the underlying signed integers 
only met the minimums specified.
<p/>
The standard should specify that implementations guarantee that a <tt>duration_cast</tt> from any smaller duration in 
these "convenience typedefs" will not overflow any larger duration. That is, <tt>hours</tt> should be able to hold 
the maximum of <tt>minutes</tt>, which should be able to hold the maximum of <tt>seconds</tt> and so on.
<p/>
More formally, if the ratio <tt>typedef A</tt> and <tt>typedef B</tt> is <tt>1:Y</tt> where <tt>Y &gt; 1</tt> (e.g., 
1 : 60 in case of <tt>minutes</tt> : <tt>seconds</tt>), then <tt>#bits<sub>A</sub>-1</tt> must be at least 
<tt>ceil(log<sub>2</sub>(2<sup>#bits<sub>B</sub>-1)/Y)</sup>)</tt>.
<p/>
In the case of <tt>minutes</tt> : <tt>seconds</tt>, <tt>X = 1</tt>, <tt>Y = 60</tt>. Let 
<tt>#bits<sub>seconds</sub> = 32</tt>. Therefore:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><tt>2<sup>(#bits<sub>seconds</sub> - 1)</sup> = 2<sup>31</sup> = 2147483648</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>ceil(log<sub>2</sub>(2<sup>31</sup> / 60) = 26</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>#bits<sub>minutes</sub> - 1 = 26</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>#bits<sub>minutes</sub> = 27</tt></p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Therefore, a minimum of 27 bits would be needed to store <tt>minutes</tt> if 32 were used to store <tt>seconds</tt>.
<p/>
I propose to change the definitions of the convenience typedefs as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<i>// convenience typedefs</i>
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 64 bits</i>,        nano&gt; nanoseconds;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 55 bits</i>,       micro&gt; microseconds;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 46 bits</i>,       milli&gt; milliseconds;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 37 bits</i>             &gt; seconds;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 32 bits</i>, ratio&lt;  60&gt;&gt; minutes;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 27 bits</i>, ratio&lt;3600&gt;&gt; hours;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
These bits were chosen to satisfy the above formula. Note that
minimums only increased, so larger ranges could be held. A nice
outcome of this choice is that <tt>minutes</tt> does not go above 32 bits.
</p>

<p><i>[2016-04-23, Tim Song comments]</i></p>

<p>
The P/R of LWG 2592 doesn't fix the issue it wants to solve, because the actual underlying type will likely 
have more bits than the specified minimum.
<p/>
Consider <tt>seconds</tt>, which the P/R requires to have at least 37 bits. On a typical system this implies 
using a 64-bit integer. To ensure that casting from <tt>seconds::max()</tt> to <tt>minutes</tt> doesn't overflow 
in such a system, it is necessary for the latter to have at least 59 bits (which means, in practice, 64 bits too), 
not just 32 bits. Thus, just changing the minimum number of bits will not be able to provide the desired guarantee 
that casting from a smaller unit to a larger one never overflow.
<p/>
If such a guarantee is to be provided, it needs to be spelled out directly. Note that the difference here is 9 bits 
(for the 1000-fold case) and 5 bits (for the 60-fold case), which is less than the size difference between integer 
types on common systems, so such a requirement would effectively require those convenience typedefs to use the 
same underlying integer type.

<h3><a name="2594" href="2594">2594.</a> Contradicting definition of empty <tt>shared_ptr</tt> on <tt>shared_ptr(nullptr, d)</tt></h3>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Latest draft (N4567) 20.3.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared">[util.smartptr.shared]</a> p1 says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A <tt>shared_ptr</tt> object is <em>empty</em> if it does not own a pointer.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Please note that it says "own a pointer". This definition was added as
the resolution for LWG defect <a href="813">813</a>.
<p/>
20.3.2.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared.const">[util.smartptr.shared.const]</a> p8 says about the effect of
<tt>shared_ptr(nullptr_t p, D d)</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects</i>: Constructs a <tt>shared_ptr</tt> object that <em>owns</em> the object <tt>p</tt> and the deleter <tt>d</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Please note that it says "<em>owns</em> the object". This was intentionally
changed from "the pointer" as a part of resolution for LWG defect <a href="758">758</a>,
to cover <tt>nullptr_t</tt> case.
<p/>
Since <tt>shared_ptr(nullptr, d)</tt> owns an object of type <tt>nullptr_t</tt>, but does
not own a pointer, it is said as "empty" by a strict reading of the
above mentioned definition in 20.3.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared">[util.smartptr.shared]</a> p1.
<p/>
These cause a contradiction:
<p/>
20.3.2.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared.const">[util.smartptr.shared.const]</a> p9 sets a postcondition
<tt>use_count() == 1</tt> on <tt>shared_ptr(nullptr, d)</tt>. But 
20.3.2.2.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared.obs">[util.smartptr.shared.obs]</a> p7 says that the return value of <tt>use_count()</tt>
is "<tt>0</tt> when <tt>*this</tt> is <em>empty</em>".
</p>
<p>
Proposed wording changes:
<p/>
Replace the last 2 words in 20.3.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared">[util.smartptr.shared]</a> p1 from
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[&hellip;] <em>empty</em> if it does not own a pointer.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
to
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[&hellip;] <em>empty</em> if it does not own an object.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Note that <tt>shared_ptr(nullptr_t)</tt> is defined to be empty in synopsis in
20.3.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared">[util.smartptr.shared]</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
constexpr shared_ptr(nullptr_t) noexcept : shared_ptr() { }
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
It could be less confusing if <tt>shared_ptr(nullptr, d)</tt> could be defined to
be empty. But it seems too late to change that (which means changing
whether the deleter is called or not, see 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11164354/">this Stackoverflow article</a>). 
Then I'm proposing just fix the contradiction.

<p>
The description of <tt>money_base::space</tt> is that "at least one space is required at that position." 
(N4582 subclause 22.4.6.3 [locale.moneypunct] paragraph 2)
<p/>
When formatting for output (30.4.7.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/locale.money.put.virtuals">[locale.money.put.virtuals]</a>), it is not clear that
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<li><p>
"the number of characters generated for the specified format" (excluding fill padding) includes exactly 
one character for <tt>money_base::space</tt> (if present), and
</p></li>
<li><p>
all characters corresponding to <tt>money_base::space</tt> (excluding fill padding) are copies of <tt>fill</tt>.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
In particular, there is implementation divergence over point (b) as to whether U+0020 or <tt>fill</tt> should be used.
Further, should a character other than <tt>fill</tt> be used, it is unclear when "the fill characters are 
placed where <tt>none</tt> or <tt>space</tt> appears in the formatting pattern", whether the fill characters are placed 
at the beginning or the end of the "space field".
<p/>
I believe that a strict interpretation of the current wording supports U+0020; however, <tt>fill</tt> is more likely 
to be the pragmatic choice.

<p>
In N4582 subclause 17.6.5.5 [member.functions], the requirement that:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
any call to the member function that would select an overload from the set of declarations described in this 
standard behaves as if that overload were selected
</p></blockquote>
<p>
is unclear in the extent of the "as if". For example, in providing:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
basic_string(const charT* s);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
for a one-argument call to:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
basic_string(const charT* s, const Allocator&amp; a = Allocator());
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
it can be read that an implementation may be required to call the copy constructor for the allocator since 
the core language rules for copy elision would not allow the "a" argument to be constructed directly into 
the member used to store the allocator.
<p/>
Clarification (even if just a note) would be appreciated.

N4582 subclause 30.4.3.3.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/facet.num.put.virtuals">[facet.num.put.virtuals]</a> paragraph 6 makes no provision for fill-padding in its

</p>

<p><i>[2017-07-06, Marshall comments]</i></p>

<p>
All the other cases from <tt>num_put</tt> &mdash; <tt>int</tt>, <tt>long</tt>, etc all are covered in 
30.4.3.3.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/facet.num.put.virtuals">[facet.num.put.virtuals]</a> p1 .. p5, which describe how to align and pad the output. (Specifically, 
stage 3) p6 does not.

libc++ implements this exactly.<br/>
Dinkumware, libstdc++ and MSVC apply padding and alignment.

Please look through the following modifications on a value <tt>v</tt> of type <tt>vector&lt;T&gt;</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
assert(v.size() &gt; 0);
v.push_back(v[0]);
v.insert(v.begin(), v[0]);
v.resize(v.size() * 2, v[0]);
v.assign(v.size() * 2, v[0]);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
All of these use an element of itself which may be moved or destroyed by
the modification.
<p/>
From what I see so far, the first three are required to work. Please
see library issue <a href="526">526</a> for validity of them.
<p/>
But only the last one is undefined because it violates a precondition of
a sequence container operation. I think this is too subtle.
<p/>
Should it be like that, really?
<p/>
The precondition is in Table 107 "Sequence container requirements" at the next 
of 24.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/sequence.reqmts">[sequence.reqmts]</a> p3.
</p>

<p>
I looked into the following implementations:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
libc++ relies on the precondition.
<p/>
It deallocates first on <tt>n &gt; capacity()</tt> case,
see <a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/libcxx/blob/release_38/include/vector#L1415">here</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
libstdc++ doesn't rely on the precondition.
<p/>
It creates temporary <tt>vector(n, t)</tt> and <tt>swap()</tt>
on <tt>n &gt; capacity()</tt> case, see
<a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/gcc_5_3_0_release/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits/vector.tcc#L223">here</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
MSVC relies on the precondition.
<p/>
It unconditionally does <tt>clear()</tt> and then <tt>insert(begin(), n, t)</tt>.
I looked into my local "<tt>%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%/Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0/VC/include/vector</tt>".
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
One drawback of libstdc++ implementation, I could find so far, is
possibly increased peek memory usage (both old and new buffer exist at
the same time). But, because the same can happen on the most other
modifications, it seems a reasonable trade-off to remove the
precondition to fill the subtle gap. Users who really needs less memory
usage can do <tt>clear()</tt> and <tt>insert()</tt> by themselves.
<p/>
I also found that <tt>basic_string::assign(n, c)</tt> is safe on this point.
At 23.4.3.7.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/string.assign">[string.assign]</a> p17:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
basic_string&amp; assign(size_type n, charT c);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects</i>: Equivalent to <tt>assign(basic_string(n, c))</tt>.
<p/>
<i>Returns</i>: <tt>*this</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
This can be seen as another gap.
<p/>
Looking back on the history, I found that the definition of <tt>assign(n, t)</tt>
was changed at C++14 for library issue <a href="2209">2209</a>. There were more restricting 
definitions like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
void assign(size_type n, const T&amp; t);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects</i>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
erase(begin(), end());
insert(begin(), n, t);
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think the precondition was probably set to accept this old definition
and is not required inherently. And if the less memory usage was really
intended, the standard is now underspecifying about that.

<p><i>[2018-05-23: Casey restores the intended design with an expansion of the original PR]</i></p>

<p>
The intended design is that all copies of a single <tt>recursive_directory_iterator</tt> share a
common block of state which includes the values returned by <tt>options</tt>, <tt>depth</tt>, and
<tt>recursion_pending</tt> - hence the mandate that those functions not be called on a
non-dereferenceable iterator in 31.12.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/fs.class.rec.dir.itr">[fs.class.rec.dir.itr]</a> para 2. To allow an
implementation with such shared state, it's necessary to make changes to the value returned by
<tt>recursion_pending()</tt> visible to <em>all copies</em> of the same dereferenceable iterator.
</p><p>
Also:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><tt>pop</tt> notionally calls <tt>increment</tt> repeatedly until the current directory is
exhausted, <tt>pop</tt> should affect the value of <tt>recursion_pending</tt> similarly to
<tt>increment</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>options</tt> is not valid for all constructor signatures described by
31.12.12.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/fs.rec.dir.itr.members">[fs.rec.dir.itr.members]</a> para 2.</p></li>
<li><p>the copies and moves don't specify what they actually <i>do</i></p></li>

<p><i>[2016-06, Oulu &mdash; Daniel comments and provides new wording]</i></p>

<p>
During the LWG discussion of this issue it has been observed, that the interpretation of the embedded <i>see below</i>
is not really clear and that we should split declaration and definition of the new overloads, so that we have a place
that allows us to specify what "<i>see below</i>" stands for. In addition, the new wording wraps the "<i>see below</i>"
as "<tt>size_type(<i>see below</i>)</tt>" to clarify the provided expression type, similar as we did for the default
constructor of <tt>unordered_map</tt>.
</p>

<p><i>[Oulu, 2016-06]</i></p>

<p>Alisdair to review wording.</p>

<p><i>[2017-08-04, Daniel and Alisdair finetune wording]</i></p>

<p>
We decided to improve the added <i>Remarks:</i> elements by changing from the previous form:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Remarks:</i> The number of buckets is implementation-defined.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
to the more elaborate form:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Remarks:</i> The initial number of buckets supplied by the <tt>size_type</tt> argument is implementation-defined.

<p><i>[2022-07-10; Daniel comments]</i></p>

<p>
It is has been noticed by Daniel Eiband on <a href="https://lists.isocpp.org/std-discussion/2022/07/1681.php">[std-discussion]</a>
that the following deduction guides for the following constructors of the set types 
<tt>std::unordered_set</tt> and <tt>std::unordered_multiset</tt> are missing:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
unordered_set(InputIterator, InputIterator, Allocator);
unordered_set(initializer_list&lt;T&gt;, Allocator);

unordered_multiset(InputIterator, InputIterator, Allocator);
unordered_multiset(initializer_list&lt;T&gt;, Allocator);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Since this issue is adding these missing constructors it should also add the associated deduction guides.
The proposed wording has been updated to this effect and also rebased to <a href="https://wg21.link/N4910">N4910</a>.

<p><i>[2022-07-15; Casey comments]</i></p>

<p>
<a href="https://wg21.link/P1206R7">P1206R7</a> added <tt>from_range_t</tt> constructors corresponding to existing iterator pair 
constructors for the standard containers. For consistency, this issue should add <tt>from_range_t</tt> 
constructors corresponding to each new iterator pair constructor.
</p>

<p><i>[2022-07-16; Daniel comments and updates wording]</i></p>

<p>
The new <tt>from_range_t</tt> constructors have been added for each added new iterator pair constructor.
Note that the corresponding deduction guides already exist.

<p>
The specification of <tt>operator&gt;&gt;(istream&amp;, complex&lt;T&gt;&amp;)</tt> is extremely short on details. 
It currently reads, in its entirety (28.4.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/complex.ops">[complex.ops]</a>/12-15):
</p>
<blockquote class="note">

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects:</i> Extracts a complex number <tt>x</tt> of the form: <tt>u</tt>, <tt>(u)</tt>, or <tt>(u,v)</tt>, 
where <tt>u</tt> is the real part and <tt>v</tt> is the imaginary part (31.7.5.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/istream.formatted">[istream.formatted]</a>).
<p/>
<i>Requires:</i> The input values shall be convertible to <tt>T</tt>.

If bad input is encountered, calls <tt>is.setstate(ios_base::failbit)</tt> (which may throw <tt>ios::failure</tt>

<i>Remarks:</i> This extraction is performed as a series of simpler extractions. Therefore, the skipping of whitespace 
is specified to be the same for each of the simpler extractions.

<p>
It is completely unclear:
</p>
<ul>
<li>which "simpler extractions" are performed,</li>
<li>how the extracted characters are matched to the special characters <tt>'('</tt>, <tt>')'</tt> and <tt>','</tt> 
(by <tt>==</tt>, or by <tt>traits::eq</tt>),</li>
<li>what is left in the stream on failure. (For example, with <tt>"(0, 0]"</tt>, libstdc++ extracts the <tt>]</tt>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
I've received this report at the <a href="mailto:cxxeditor@gmail.com">project editor mail alias</a>, and it seems like it may be worthy of a LWG issue:
</p>
<blockquote class="note">
<p>
I recently had this problem: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>I was storing data in a vector of <tt>__uint128_t</tt>s</li>
<li>I used a sorting library which used <tt>numeric_limits&lt;T&gt;::max()</tt> as a sentinel value</li>
<li>GCC's libstdc++ provides a <tt>numeric_limits</tt> specialisation for that type, but</li>
<li>Clang's libc++ does not.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This broke the sorting for me on different platforms, and it was quite difficult to determine why. If the default 
<tt>numeric_limits</tt> didn't default to <tt>0</tt>s and <tt>false</tt> values (18.3.2.4 of N4582), and instead 
<tt>static_assert</tt>ed, causing my code to not compile, I would have found the solution immediately.
<p/>
I know that <tt>__uint128_t</tt> is non-standard, so neither GCC nor Clang is doing the wrong thing nor the right thing 
here. I could just submit a patch to libc++ providing the specialisations, but it doesn't fix the problem at its core.
<p/>
I am wondering, what is the rationale behind the defaults being <tt>0</tt> and <tt>false</tt>? It seems like it is 
inviting a problem for any future numeric types, whether part of a library, compiler extension, and possibly even 
future updates to C++'s numeric types. I think it would be much better to prevent code that tries to use 
unspecified <tt>numeric_limits</tt> from compiling.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
An alternative to this suggestion would be to still define the primary template, but not provide any of the members 
except <tt>is_specialized</tt>. Either way, this would make <tt>numeric_limits</tt> members SFINAEable.
<p/>
Along the same lines, one might wonder why the members that only make sense for floating-point types are required to 
be defined to nonsense values for integer types.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
It should be considered whether the description of the
single-object allocation functions should say "or smaller", like
the array allocation functions. For example, according to 17.6.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/new.delete.single">[new.delete.single]</a> p1 (emphasis mine):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The allocation function (3.7.4.1) called by a new-expression (5.3.4) to allocate <tt>size</tt> bytes of
storage suitably aligned to represent any object <em>of that size</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In contrast to this, 17.6.3.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/new.delete.array">[new.delete.array]</a> p1 says (emphasis mine):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The allocation function (3.7.4.1) called by the array form of a new-expression (5.3.4) to allocate
<tt>size</tt> bytes of storage suitably aligned to represent any array object <em>of that size or smaller</em>. 
(footnote: It is not the direct responsibility of <tt>operator new[](std::size_t)</tt> or <tt>operator delete[](void*)</tt> 
to note the repetition count or element size of the array. Those operations are performed elsewhere in the array 
<tt>new</tt> and <tt>delete</tt> expressions. The array <tt>new</tt> expression, may, however, increase the size 
argument to operator <tt>new[](std::size_t)</tt> to obtain space to store supplemental information.)

<p>
Why the inconsistency? Should all the cases have a SFINAE requirement?
<p/>
I see that variant has an additional requirement (<tt>T</tt> occurs exactly once in <tt>Types...</tt>), but that 
only agues that it must be a SFINAE condition &mdash; doesn't say that the other cases (any/variant) should not.
<p/>
<tt>map</tt>/<tt>multimap</tt>/<tt>unordered_map</tt>/<tt>unordered_multimap</tt> have SFINAE'd versions of 
<tt>emplace</tt> that don't take <tt>initializer_list</tt>s, but they don't have any <tt>emplace</tt> versions 
that take ILs.
<p/>
Suggested resolution:
<p/>
Add SFINAE requirements to <tt>optional::emplace(Args&amp;&amp;... args)</tt> and 
<tt>any::emplace(Args&amp;&amp;... args);</tt>
</p>

<p><i>[2020-05-10; Daniel comments and provides wording]</i></p>

<p>
The inconsistency between the two <tt>any::emplace</tt> overloads have been removed by resolving LWG
<a href="2754">2754</a> to use <i>Constraints:</i> elements. The last Mandating paper 
(<a href="https://wg21.link/p1460r1">P1460R1</a>), adopted in Prague, changed the <i>Requires:</i> elements
for <tt>variant::emplace</tt>, "<tt>I &lt; sizeof...(Types)</tt>" to <i>Mandates:</i>, but that paper
was focused on fixing inappropriate preconditions, not searching for consistency here. Given that the
<tt>in_place_index_t</tt> constructors of <tt>variant</tt> uses SFINAE-conditions for this form of static
precondition violation, I recommend that its <tt>emplace</tt> functions use the same style, which would bring 
them also in consistency with their corresponding type-based <tt>emplace</tt> forms that are 
<i>Mandates:</i>-free but delegate to the index-based forms.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The C++14 standard contains no language that guarantees the deleter run by a
<tt>shared_ptr</tt> will see all associated <tt>weak_ptr</tt> instances as expired. For example,
the standard doesn't appear to guarantee that the assertion in the following
snippet won't fire:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::weak_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; weak;
std::shared_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; strong{
  new Foo,
  [&amp;weak] (Foo* f) {
    assert(weak.expired());
    delete f;
  },
};

weak = strong;
strong.reset();
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
It seems clear that the intent is that associated <tt>weak_ptr</tt>s are expired,
because otherwise <tt>shared_ptr</tt> deleters could resurrect a reference to an object
that is being deleted.
<p/>
Suggested fix: 20.3.2.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared.dest">[util.smartptr.shared.dest]</a> should specify that the decrease in
<tt>use_count()</tt> caused by the destructor is sequenced before the call to the
deleter or the call to <tt>delete p</tt>.
</p>

<p><i>[2016-11-08, Jonathan and STL suggest NAD]</i></p>

<p>
STL and Jonathan feel that the example has unspecified behaviour, and the
assertion is allowed to fire, and that's OK (the program's expectation
is not reasonable). Otherwise it's necessary to move-construct a copy
of the deleter and use that copy to destroy the owned pointer. We do
not want to be required to do that.
</p>
<p>See also <a href="2262">2262</a>.</p>

<p><i>[2017-09-20, Jonathan comments]</i></p>

<p>
I'd like to withdraw my NAD suggestion. The value of <tt>use_count()</tt> is already observable during the destructor via 
<tt>shared_ptr</tt> and <tt>weak_ptr</tt> objects that share ownership, so specifying when it changes ensures correct 
behaviour.

<p>
Related: <a href="2748">2748</a> swappable traits for optionals, <a href="2749">2749</a> swappable traits for variants.
</p>
<p>
The adoption of <a href="https://wg21.link/p0185r1">P0185R1</a> "Adding [nothrow-]swappable traits" makes certain 
non-swappable types indirectly swappable. Consider a type defined as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct non_swappable {
  friend void swap(non_swappable&amp;, non_swappable&amp;) = delete;
};

non_swappable ns1, ns2;
using std::swap;
swap(ns1, ns2); // ill-formed

static_assert(std::is_swappable_v&lt;non_swappable&gt; == false); // holds
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Lvalues of type <tt>non_swappable</tt> are not swappable, as defined by 16.4.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/swappable.requirements">[swappable.requirements]</a>, 
overload resolution selects the deleted function. Consistently, <tt>is_swappable_v&lt;non_swappable&gt;</tt> yields 
false. It should be noted that since <tt>non_swappable</tt> is move constructible and move assignable, a qualified 
call to <tt>std::swap</tt> would be well-formed, even under P0185. Now consider the following snippet:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::tuple&lt;non_swappable&gt; tns1, tns2;
using std::swap;
swap(tns1, tns2); // previously ill-formed, now well-formed

static_assert(std::is_swappable_v&lt;std::tuple&lt;non_swappable&gt;&gt; == false); // fires
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Before P0185, this snippet would violate the implicit requirement of specialized swap for tuples that each tuple 
element be swappable. After P0185, this specialized swap overload for tuples would be SFINAEd away, resulting 
in overload resolution selecting the base swap overload, and performing the exchange via move construction and 
move assignment of tuples.
<p/>
This issue affects all of <tt>pair</tt>, <tt>tuple</tt>, <tt>unique_ptr</tt>, <tt>array</tt>, <tt>queue</tt>, 
<tt>priority_queue</tt>, <tt>stack</tt>, and should eventually also apply to <tt>optional</tt> and <tt>variant</tt>.

<p>
Throughout <tt>optional</tt>/<tt>variant</tt>/<tt>any</tt>'s specification references are made to "the selected constructor 
of <tt>T</tt>". For example, 22.5.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/optional.ctor">[optional.ctor]</a>/16 says of the constructor from <tt>const T&amp;</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
-16- <i>Remarks:</i> If <tt>T</tt>'s selected constructor is a <tt>constexpr</tt> constructor, this constructor shall be a 
<tt>constexpr</tt> constructor.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Similarly, the in-place constructor has this wording (22.5.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/optional.ctor">[optional.ctor]</a>/25-26):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
-25- <i>Throws:</i> Any exception thrown by the selected constructor of <tt>T</tt>.
<p/>
-26- <i>Remarks:</i> If <tt>T</tt>'s constructor selected for the initialization is a <tt>constexpr</tt> constructor, 
this constructor shall be a <tt>constexpr</tt> constructor.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
If <tt>T</tt> is a scalar type, it has no constructor at all. Moreover, even for 
class types, the in-place constructor wording ignores any implicit conversion done on the argument before the selected 
constructor is called, which 1) may not be valid in constant expressions and 2) may throw an exception; such exceptions 
aren't thrown "by the selected constructor of <tt>T</tt>" but outside it.
<p/>
The wording should probably be recast to refer to the entire initialization.

<p><b>View all issues with</b> <a href="lwg-status.html#New">New</a> status.</p>
<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
While SG1 was processing NB comments CA1 and LATE2 regarding <a href="https://wg21.link/p0270r1">P0270R1</a>, 
we decided to remove the proposed guarantee that <tt>quick_exit</tt> be made signal safe.
<p/>
Our reasoning is that functions registered with <tt>at_quick_exit</tt> aren't forbidden from calling 
<tt>quick_exit</tt>, but <tt>quick_exit</tt> implementations likely acquire some form of a lock before 
processing all registered functions (because a note forbids the implementation from introducing data races).
<p/>
The following code can therefore deadlock:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;

int main() 
{
  std::at_quick_exit([] () { std::quick_exit(0); });
  std::quick_exit(1);
  return 0;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The same applies if a function registered in <tt>at_quick_exit</tt> handles a signal, and that signal calls 
<tt>quick_exit</tt>. SG1 believes that both issues (same thread deadlock, and signal deadlock) can be resolved 
in the same manner. Either:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify that calling <tt>quick_exit</tt> while servicing <tt>quick_exit</tt> is undefined; or</li>
<li>Specifying that calling <tt>quick_exit</tt> while servicing <tt>quick_exit</tt> is defined to not deadlock, 
and instead calls <tt>_Exit</tt> without calling further registered functions.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Option 2. seems preferable, and can be implemented along the lines of:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;array&gt;
#include &lt;atomic&gt;
#include &lt;cstddef&gt;

namespace {

  typedef void (*func)();
  
  std::array&lt;func, 32&gt; quick_exit_functions;
  
  const auto* quick_exit_functions_ptr = &amp;quick_exit_functions;
  
  std::atomic_flag lock = ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT;
  
  struct scope 
  {
    scope() { while (lock.test_and_set(std::memory_order_acquire)) ; }
    ~scope() { lock.clear(std::memory_order_release); }
  };
  
}

namespace std {

  extern "C" void quick_exit(int status) noexcept
  {
    decltype(quick_exit_functions_ptr) f;
    {
      scope s;
      f = quick_exit_functions_ptr;
      quick_exit_functions_ptr = nullptr;
    }
    if (f) {
      size_t pos = f-&gt;size();
      while (pos &gt; 0)
        (*f)[--pos]();
    }
    _Exit(status);
  }
  
  extern "C++" int at_quick_exit(func f) noexcept
  {
    scope s;
    if (!quick_exit_functions_ptr || quick_exit_functions.size() == quick_exit_functions.max_size())
      return -1;
    quick_exit_functions[quick_exit_functions.size()] = f;
    return 0;
  }

}

Ideally, the resolution would also add back the wording which SG1 dropped from <a href="https://wg21.link/p0270r1">P0270R1</a>:

<p/>
Per 21.3.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/meta.unary.prop">[meta.unary.prop]</a>'s Table 38, this trait looks at whether the following variable definition is 
known to call no operation that is not trivial:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
S t(create&lt;Args&gt;()...);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
... where <tt>Args</tt> is an empty pack in this case. That variable definition results in a call to the <tt>S</tt> destructor. 
Should that call be considered by the trait?

<tt>D t(declval&lt;D&gt;());</tt>, to not call any nontrivial operations.
<p/>
This is interpreted by implementations to include the destructor call,
presumably for consistency with <tt>is_nothrow_copy_constructible</tt>. 
But that's wrong; the copy constructor <em>is</em> trivial.
<p/>
As a consequence, <tt>variant&lt;D&gt;</tt> also doesn't have a trivial

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The library has lots of functions declared <tt>constexpr</tt>, but it's not clear what that means. The <tt>constexpr</tt> 
keyword implies that there needs to be <em>some</em> invocation of the function, for <em>some</em> set of template 
arguments and function arguments, that is valid in a constant expression (otherwise the program would be ill-formed, 
with no diagnostic required), along with a few side conditions. I suspect the library intends to require something a 
lot stronger than that from implementations (something along the lines of "all calls that could reasonably be constant 
subexpressions are in fact constant subexpressions, unless otherwise stated").
<p/>
[variant.ctor]/1 contains this, which should also be fixed:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"This function shall be <tt>constexpr</tt> if and only if the value-initialization of the alternative type <tt>T0</tt> 
would satisfy the requirements for a <tt>constexpr</tt> function."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is the wrong constraint: instead of constraining whether the function is <tt>constexpr</tt>, we should constrain 
whether a call to it is a constant subexpression.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
If we write <tt>a_uniq.insert(i, j)</tt> and <tt>[i, j)</tt> has multiple elements with keys that compare equivalent, 
which ones get inserted? Consider, for example, inserting into a <tt>map&lt;string, int&gt;</tt> with
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
m.insert({{"red", 5}, {"green", 3}, {"red", 7}, {"blue", 2}, {"pink", 6}});
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Which value for <tt>"red"</tt> will the map have?
<p/>
On my implementation we got <tt>"red" -&gt; 5</tt>, and I suspect that's true on most or all implementations, but I don't believe 
that's guaranteed by anything in the requirements. The wording in Table 90 just says that it "inserts each element from 
the range <tt>[i, j)</tt> if and only if there is no element with key equivalent to the key of that element", but that 
doesn't tell us what happens if <tt>[i, j)</tt> contains duplicate keys because it doesn't say what order the insertions 
are performed in. The standard should either guarantee that the first value is the one that gets inserted, or explicitly 
say that this is unspecified.
<p/>
The same issue applies to the range constructor, and to the unordered associative containers.

LWG discussion. Suggestion to specify that we like the direction of the wording for <tt>insert</tt> of
unordered containers, but would also like to clarify that the loop is meant to be "in order" of the 
sequence elements.

</p>
<blockquote><p>
A <tt><i>TransformationTrait</i></tt> modifies a property of a type. It shall be a class template that takes

<p>
<tt>enable_if</tt>, <tt>result_of</tt> and <tt>common_type</tt> do not necessarily "define a publicly accessible nested type named <tt>type</tt>". 
<tt>aligned_storage</tt> takes no template type argument (it only has two non-type parameters). Yet [meta.trans]/2

<p/>
Incidentally, with the exception of <tt>decay</tt>, it's not clear that any of the traits in [meta.trans.other]

<p>
In [cmplx.over] and [cmath.syn], when talking about "sufficient additional overloads", we use the phrase
"effectively cast", but that is not a defined term.
<p/>
A hostile interpretation could read "<tt>reinterpret_cast</tt>" here.
<p/>
Likely we mean "apply floating-point promotions, floating-integral
conversions, and floating-point conversions", but that should be
spelled out somewhere, e.g. in the library definitions section.

28.4.9 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/cmplx.over">[cmplx.over]</a>, because those conversions can all be done implicitly. This also holds for the 
<tt>pow</tt> specification 28.4.9 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/cmplx.over">[cmplx.over]</a> p3, because the described conversions of
<tt>complex&lt;T&gt;</tt> to <tt>complex&lt;U&gt;</tt> involve only the need of non-explicit constructors.

<p>
With <a href="https://wg21.link/p0175r1">P0175R1</a>, we now show in [cmath.syn] three overloads for
the <tt>sin</tt> function: One taking a <tt>float</tt>, one taking a <tt>double</tt>,
and one taking a <tt>long double</tt>. However, there is no statement that <tt>sin(long double)</tt> 
should actually invoke <tt>sinl</tt>, presumably delivering extra precision.
<p/>
An implementation like
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
inline long double sin(long double x)
{ return sinf(x); }
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
seems to satisfy the "effectively cast" requirement, but is certainly unintentional.
<p/>
The same issue arises for all math functions inherited from C.

20.4.5.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/mem.res.pool.options">[mem.res.pool.options]</a> p3 talks about a "pass-through-threshold".
<p/>
First, the phrase is not defined and it seems it could be easily avoided given the context.
<p/>
Second, given the phrasing here, it seems the implementation is essentially allowed to 
ignore the value <tt>largest_required_pool_block</tt> as it sees fit. It is unclear whether 
that is the intention.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Further to LWG <a href="2472">2472</a>, the case of <tt>reverse_iterator</tt> comparisons is a regression introduced 
by LWG <a href="280">280</a>.
<p/>
Consider the following program:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;utility&gt;
#include &lt;iterator&gt;

using namespace std::rel_ops;

bool f(std::reverse_iterator&lt;int *&gt; it) { return it != it; }
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Under C++03, the <tt>operator!=</tt> in lib.reverse.iterator is more specialized than the <tt>operator!=</tt> in <tt>std::rel_ops</tt>.
<p/>
Following LWG <a href="280">280</a>, neither <tt>operator!=</tt> candidate is more specialized than the other. The program is 
observed to fail with libc++.
<p/>
Online compiler example, see <a href="http://melpon.org/wandbox/permlink/aeOn1wiOi2CRKwwc">here</a>.
<p/>
Suggested resolution:
<p/>
Reintroduce the homogeneous comparison operators from C++03 alongside the new ones.

<p>
The standard library should provide <tt>string_view</tt> parameters instead or in addition for functions defined with 
<tt>char const *</tt> or <tt>string const &amp;</tt> as parameter types. Most notably in cases where both such 
overloads exist or where an internal copy is expected anyway.
</p>
<p>
It might be doubted that the non-null termination of <tt>string_view</tt> could be an issue with functions that pass 
the <tt>char *</tt> down to OS functions, such as <tt>fstream_buf::open()</tt> etc. and those shouldn't provide it 
and favour generating a <tt>std::string</tt> temporary instead in that case. However, <tt>std::path</tt> demonstrates 
it is usable to have <tt>string_view</tt> overloads and there might be many places where it can be handy, or even better.
</p>

<p>Proposed change: Provide the overloads for <tt>std::regex</tt>, the exception classes, <tt>std::bitset</tt>, 
<tt>std::locale</tt> and more.</p>

<p><tt>noexcept</tt> is inconsistently applied across headers which import components of the C standard library into the C++ library; 
some functions (<tt>std::abort()</tt>, <tt>std::_Exit()</tt>, etc) are defined as <tt>noexcept</tt> in some places, but not in others. 
Some functions which seem like they should be <tt>noexcept</tt> (<tt>std::abs()</tt>, <tt>std::div()</tt>, etc) are not defined as

<p>
It seems that <tt>std::next</tt> is missing an optimization opportunity when taking a single parameter. The standard 
mandates that <tt>std::next</tt> shall call <tt>std::advance</tt> on the passed iterator and return it. For random-access 
iterators, it means that <tt>operator+=</tt> will be called on the iterator. However, if a single-argument overload was 
added to <tt>std::next</tt>, it could call <tt>++it</tt> directly instead of <tt>std::advance(it, 1)</tt>, which means 
that <tt>operator++</tt> would be called instead of <tt>operator+=</tt>. This might make a small performance difference 
for complicated iterators such as <tt>std::deque</tt>'s ones, where <tt>operator++</tt> has a simpler logic than 
<tt>operator+=</tt>.
<p/>
An equivalent optimization could be allowed by adding a single-argument overload to <tt>std::prev</tt> too.

<p>
Jonathan suggested NAD, because the proposed "just use increment when <tt>n==1</tt>" optimization can be done in 
<tt>std::next</tt> (and/or <tt>std::advance</tt>, and/or complicated iterators like <tt>deque::iterator</tt>) without 
adding an overload. Billy said the overload would avoid metaprogramming costs for dispatching to the right 
<tt>std::advance</tt>, and help in non-optimized builds. Zhihao said the overload would make it clear to users that 
the <tt>n==1</tt> case is optimized (Jonathan thinks this is irrelevant as there's no requirement that we tell users 
what we optimize).

The current PR for LWG <a href="2773">2773</a> changes <tt>std::ignore</tt> to be a <tt>constexpr</tt> variable. However it says 
nothing about whether using <tt>std::ignore</tt> in <tt>std::tie</tt> is a constant expression. I think the intent was clearly 
to allow this. Therefore I suggest we update the resolution to explicitly call this out in a note. (I don't think new normative 
wording is needed).
<p/>
I propose we update the current PR as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Keep the current changes proposed by the PR.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a note after [tuple.creation]/p7 (<tt>std::tie</tt>):</p>

Perhaps LWG feels the existing wording is clear enough, but if not I think the above changes sufficiently clarify it.
<p/>
The ability to <tt>constexpr</tt> assign to <tt>std::ignore</tt> can be important: Here is an extremely contrived example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>

}
static_assert(foo());

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
LWG <a href="2797">2797</a> (RU 2) suggests that certain type-traits should be required to
diagnose violations of their pre-conditions. The basic idea is founded and I see no problems for
requiring this for the mentioned traits <tt>alignment_of</tt> or <tt>is_base_of</tt>,
for example. But if we want to require this diagnostics for some other traits, such as <tt>is_convertible</tt>,
<tt>is_constructible</tt> (and friends), or <tt>is_callable</tt> (and possibly some others), we really should
be sure that our current requirements are OK. 
<p/>
Unfortunately, there exists some cases, where we currently overspecify imposing complete type requirements where they
are not actually required. For example, for the following situation the answer of the trait could 
be given without ever needing the complete type of <tt>X</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct X; // Never defined

static_assert(std::is_convertible_v&lt;X, const X&amp;&gt;);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Unfortunately we cannot <em>always</em> allow incomplete types, because most type constructions or conversions indeed
require a complete type, so <em>generally</em> relaxing the current restrictions is also not an option.
<p/>
The core language has a solution for this "small" gap of situations, where the response of the compiler <em>might</em>
depend on type completeness: Undefined behaviour. So, I believe we need a somewhat more detailled form to express the
intend here. Informally, I would suggest that the program should only be ill-formed in the situation described by 
LWG <a href="2797">2797</a>, if there exists the <em>possibility</em> that the compiler would require complete types for the
considered operation. The example shown above, <tt>std::is_convertible_v&lt;X, const X&amp;&gt;</tt>, would <b>never</b>
require the need to complete <tt>X</tt>, so here no violation should exist.
<p/>
The presented example might seem a tiny one, but the Standard Library type traits are extreme fundamental tools and we should
try to not give the impression that an approximate rule of the current type constraints breaks reasonable code.
<p/>
It is correct, that above example has currently undefined behaviour due to the breakage of pre-conditions, therefore
this issue suggests to fix the current situation <em>before</em> enforcing a diagnostic for such valid situations.

<p>
During the application of <a href="https://wg21.link/p0430r2">P0430R2</a>, we came across several terms that seem insufficiently 
clear and lacking proper definitions.
<p/>
We would like clarification on what those terms mean, and we would welcome wording suggestions, or alternatively a verbose explanation and dispensation to change the presentation editorially.
<p/>
The items in question are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What does it mean to 'always interpret [the character sequence] in the same way'? ([fs.enum.path.format], which is 
[path.format] in the paper)</p></li>
<li><p>What is a "directory-like" file type? ([fs.class.directory_iterator])</p></li>
<li><p>What is an "implementation-defined file type"? (e.g. [fs.op.copy])</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
In 31.12.8.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/fs.enum.path.format">[fs.enum.path.format]</a> "always interpreted in the same way" means
irrespective of the <tt>path::format</tt> value, or the content of the string.
Maybe add ", rather than depending on the <tt>path::format</tt> value or the
content of the character sequence".
<p/>
In  [fs.class.directory_iterator] an "implementation-defined
directory-like file type" is an implementation-defined file type (see
 [fs.enum.file_type] and Table 115) that is treated like a directory by
the special rules that the OS has for non-regular files (see 31.12.6.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/fs.path.generic">[fs.path.generic]</a>).
<p/>
In 31.12.13.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/fs.op.copy">[fs.op.copy]</a>, an "implementation-defined file type" is exactly
that, see  [fs.enum.file_type] and Table 115 again. I don't see what
isn't clear about that. Maybe add a cross-reference to  [fs.enum.file_type].

<p>
The standard requires that <tt>char_traits&lt;char16_t&gt;::int_type</tt> is
<tt>uint_least16_t</tt>, so when that has the same representation as <tt>char16_t</tt>
there are no bits left to represent the <tt>eof</tt> value.
<p/>
23.2.4.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/char.traits.specializations.char16.t">[char.traits.specializations.char16.t]</a> says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&mdash; The member <tt>eof()</tt> shall return an implementation-defined constant
that cannot appear as a valid UTF-16 code unit.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Existing practice is to use the "noncharacter" <tt>u'\uffff'</tt> for this
value, but the Unicode spec is clear that <tt>U+FFFF</tt> and other
noncharacters are valid, and their appearance in a UTF-16 string does
not make it ill-formed. See <a href="http://www.unicode.org/faq/private_use.html#nonchar7">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/faq/private_use.html#nonchar8">here</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>The fact that they are called "noncharacters" and are not intended for open interchange does not mean 
that they are somehow illegal or invalid code points which make strings containing them invalid.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In practice this means there's no way to tell if
<tt>basic_streambuf&lt;char16_t&gt;::sputc(u'\uffff')</tt> succeeded or not. If it
can insert the character it returns <tt>to_int_type(u'\uffff')</tt> and
otherwise it returns <tt>eof()</tt>, which is the same value.
<p/>
I believe that <tt>char_traits&lt;char16_t&gt;::to_int_type(char_type c)</tt> can be
defined to transform <tt>U+FFFF</tt> into <tt>U+FFFD</tt>, so that the invariant
<tt>eq_int_type(eof(), to_int_type(c)) == false</tt> holds for any <tt>c</tt> (and the
return value of <tt>sputc</tt> will be distinct from <tt>eof</tt>). I don't think any
implementation currently meets that invariant.
<p/>
I think at the very least we need to correct the statement "The member
<tt>eof()</tt> shall return an implementation-defined constant that cannot
appear as a valid UTF-16 code unit", because there are no such
constants if <tt>sizeof(uint_least16_t) == sizeof(char16_t)</tt>.
<p/>
This issue is closely related to LWG <a href="1200">1200</a>, but there it's a
slightly different statement of the problem, and neither the
submitter's recommendation nor the proposed resolution solves this
issue here. It seems that was closed as NAD before the Unicode corrigendum
existed, so at the time our standard just gave "surprising results"
but wasn't strictly wrong. Now it makes a normative statement that
conflicts with Unicode.

<p>
In Table 95 in 25.3.5.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/input.iterators">[input.iterators]</a>, it is specified that the expression <tt>*a</tt> returns <tt>reference</tt>, 
which must be convertible to <tt>value_type</tt>. This is not true for move-only types, which incidentally means that
<tt>std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt;&gt;</tt> does not possess even a lowly <tt>InputIterator</tt>, which is, of 
course, absurd.
<p/>
With the advent of concepts as first-class citizens in the language, getting this right as soon as possible is a priority.
<p/>
This issue seems to be similar to both LWG <a href="448">448</a> and LWG <a href="484">484</a>, but not the same.
<p/>
The proposed resolution stems from two considerations outlined below:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Convertibility is too strong for all algorithms</b>
<p/>
No algorithm in the standard library requires convertibility to <tt>value_type</tt>. If algorithms require things that smell 
of that, they specify the assignment or constructibility flavor they need directly. I checked this by going through the 
specification of each and every one of them in <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;numeric&gt;</tt>, which highlighted 
several issues unrelated to this one. These issues are presented in <em>Algorithms with underspecified iterator requirements</em>
(LWG <a href="2963">2963</a>).
<p/>
<b><tt>reference</tt> needs to be related to <tt>value_type</tt></b>
<p/>
Algorithms need this for the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>lifetime-extension: served as adequately by <tt>T const&amp;</tt> as by <tt>T</tt>. Also works for iterators that 
return by value. <tt>T&amp;&amp;</tt> also correctly binds to <tt>T const&amp;</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>passing to predicates: again, served adequately by <tt>T const&amp;</tt></p></li>
<li><p>writing to <tt>*result</tt>: not provided by the requirement anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>capture-by-copy: currently implicitly guaranteed, but unused in the standard library (always specified separately). 
A separate specification can always be made for algorithms that need to capture-by-copy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
We must give due consideration to code that so far required its inputs to be <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> implicitly by 
requiring convertibility to <tt>T</tt>. This is done in the issue LWG <a href="2963">2963</a>, 
which presents the results of a comb-through of <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;numeric&gt;</tt> to find algorithms 
that have this requirement, but where it is not specified. While related issues have been identified, no algorithms seems 
to require more than <tt>T const&amp;</tt> convertibility without separately requiring convertibility to <tt>T</tt>.
<p/>
Since such code is already compiling today, relaxing this requirement does not break code.
<p/>
The only code this could possibly break is if, in a concept checking library, the <tt>InputIterator</tt> concept requirement 
on <tt>reference</tt> being convertible to <tt>value_type</tt> gets relaxed. Such a library, if it offered overloading based 
on most-specific modeled concept, could now, once fixed, resolve the call to a different algorithm, which could break user 
code that uses a hypothetical algorithm with a move-only container and was relying to select some other overload for move-only 
types based on the implicit <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> assertion provided by the iterator.
<p/>
In our internal concepts-checking library, we have had this issue "fixed" since the very beginning &mdash; move-only types 
were too important for our internal algorithms library, and also no algorithm in it seems to require something like 
<tt>Iterator::value_type x = *first</tt> without also requiring copy-constructibility anyway.

<p><i>[2018-04-20; Eric Niebler provides improved wording]</i></p>

<p>
The revised wording makes it clear that you can only rely on those operational semantics when 
the value type is constructible from the reference type and is movable. When those conditions 
aren't met, we can make no guarantees about the operational semantics of <tt>*r++</tt> (which 
is why <tt>*r++</tt> is no longer a required expression of the <tt>InputIterator</tt> concept 
in the Ranges TS).
<p/>
Really, <em>no</em> generic code should be doing <tt>*r++</tt> on input iterators. Another 
option would be to simply deprecate this requirement for input iterators, but that might need 
a paper. (For forward iterators, <tt>*r++</tt> is already required to return <tt>reference</tt> 
exactly, and the multi-pass guarantee gives it the proper semantics.)
<p/>
I also now have a question about the proposed return type of <tt>*a</tt> and <tt>*r++</tt>, 
which says they must be something that "binds to <tt>const T&amp;</tt>". Does this mean that an 
iterator with a reference type reference-to-[<tt>const</tt>?]-<tt>volatile</tt>-<tt>T</tt> is no longer 
considered an iterator? I don't think that's what we want to say. Perhaps these should read 
"binds to <tt>const volatile T&amp;</tt> instead, except that has the problem for InputIterators 
that return prvalues that a prvalue is not bindable to a volatile reference.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
While researching whether the proposed resolution of Iterators of Containers of move-only types do not model <tt>InputIterator</tt>
(LWG <a href="2962">2962</a>), I came across several algorithms that underspecify their requirements, mostly with regard to some associated type of the iterator type they operate on. A list can be found below.
<p/>
The list of algorithms with underspecified requirements from <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;numeric&gt;</tt> follows.
<p/>
With the advent of concepts, these algorithms will need better specifications if we are ever hoping to be allowed to overload based on them. I want this issue to bring the standard algorithms closer to having their concept requirements directly transcribable to library annotations.

<p>
At the moment, <tt>inplace_merge</tt> requires exactly <tt><i>N</i> - 1</tt> comparisons, if enough additional memory is 
available (and in practice enough additional memory is always available). However, this prohibits implementing the 
merge operation using forms of binary search, as in Timsort's 
<a href="https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Objects/listsort.txt#l451">'Galloping Mode'</a>, a useful optimization 
for non-uniform input data. It's not really useful to prohibit standard libraries from trying a few extra speculative 
compares like this, given that users must be prepared for the fallback "not enough memory" 
&#x1d4aa;(<tt><i>N</i> lg <i>N</i></tt>) algorithm.

<p>
[ext.manip] p5 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires:</i> The type <tt>moneyT</tt> shall be either <tt>long double</tt> or a specialization of the 
<tt>basic_string</tt> template (Clause 24).
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This means that <tt>put_money(99)</tt>, <tt>put_money(99.)</tt>, <tt>put_money("99")</tt>, and 
<tt>put_money(string_view{"99"})</tt> are all undefined, when in practice they will compile fine and 
do the right thing, converting the argument to <tt>long double</tt> or <tt>std::string</tt> as needed.
<p/>
We could change it to be "otherwise the program is ill-formed", or to remove the function templates from overload 
resolution when the argument is not <tt>long double</tt> or a <tt>std::basic_string</tt>, but that will unnecessarily 
break code that works fine today. We should accept types convertible to <tt>long double</tt> or the relevant 
<tt>money_put</tt> facet's <tt>string_type</tt> (which is not known until we attempt to write the unspecified 
type to an ostream).
<p/>
The requirement is also insufficient, because <tt>cout &lt;&lt; put_money(wstring(L"99"))</tt> won't compile on any 
implementation, despite the argument type being a specialization of <tt>basic_string</tt>. This same problem exists 
for <tt>std::get_money</tt>.
</p>

<p><i>[2017-06-24, Daniel comments and provides wording]</i></p>

<p>
The wording changes below are supposed to support all <tt>moneyT</tt> types that are convertible to either 
<tt>long double</tt> or to <tt>money_put/get&lt;Ch, o/istreambuf_iterator&lt;Ch, Tr&gt;&gt;::string_type</tt> 
(but not to both), where <tt>Ch</tt> and <tt>Tr</tt> are determined by the concrete instantiated specialization of the 
exposition-only function template <tt>f</tt> that is used to specify the semantics of <tt>put_money</tt> and 
<tt>get_money</tt>, respectively. XOR-ing the requirements outlaws types that are convertible to both, which 
would cause an ambiguity unless we would provide wording that would introduce an ordered application of these 
convertibility constraints. This is the rationale for the seemingly odd new <i>Remarks</i> formulation. Note also,
that the wording provided below intentionally attempts to distinguish between the statically testable
conditions based on the <tt>is_convertible_v</tt> expressions within the <i>Remarks:</i> element and the well-defined 
runtime behaviour requirement of the actually provided argument of deduced type <tt>moneyT</tt> within the 
pre-existing <i>Requires:</i> element. Another point worth pointing out is that the wording attempts to fix an
currently existing ambiguity of the meaning of the type <tt>moneyT</tt> (and to a lesser extend for <tt>charT</tt> and
<tt>traits</tt>) as either the template parameter of <tt>put/get_money</tt> or that of the corresponding template
argument of the exposition-only <tt>f</tt> templates. The revised form makes it clearer that it refers to the latter.
<p/>
It should be emphasized that this extension of the current wording would provide support for <tt>put_money(99)</tt>, 
<tt>put_money(99.)</tt>, and <tt>put_money("99")</tt>, but <em>not</em> yet for <tt>put_money(string_view{"99"})</tt>, 
because <tt>string_view</tt> is not convertible to <tt>string</tt>. To realize support for the latter, this wording 
approach could be extended by referring to <tt>is_constructible</tt> instead of <tt>is_convertible</tt>, though.

<p>
The fine folks on our backend team suggested that we special case <tt>std::reverse</tt> of 1/2/4/8 to take 
advantage of vector units. Unfortunately, at present <tt>std::reverse</tt> says it does <tt>N/2 iter_swap</tt>s, 
which doesn't permit our vector implementation even if the iterator inputs are pointers to trivially copyable <tt>T</tt>s.
<p/>
The vectorized version for pointers to <tt>short</tt>s is 
<a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareMinigun/status/878150939512717312">~8x faster on Skylake</a> than the serial version, 
and about 7x faster for <tt>unsigned long long</tt>s; and users don't actually care whether or not we call <tt>swap</tt> here.

<p>
This issue should be resolved by <a href="https://wg21.link/p0551">P0551</a>, because it prohibits user specialization of  
<tt>std::swap</tt> and <tt>std::iter_swap</tt>, which means the proposed vectorization optimization for 
pointers-to-trivially-copyable is now implementable without changes to <tt>reverse</tt>'s specification (We can detect 
if the user has provided an alternate <tt>swap</tt> in their own namespace, but not if they explicitly specialized

In <a href="https://wg21.link/n4660">N4660</a> subclause 31.13 [re.grammar] paragraph 5:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The productions <tt>ClassAtomExClass</tt>, <tt>ClassAtomCollatingElement</tt> and <tt>ClassAtomEquivalence</tt> provide
functionality equivalent to that of the same features in regular expressions in POSIX.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The broadness of the above statement makes it sound like it is merely a statement of intent; however, this appears to 
be a necessary normative statement insofar as identifying the general semantics to be associated with the syntactic 
forms identified. In any case, if it is meant for <tt>ClassAtomCollatingElement</tt> to provide functionality equivalent 
to a collating symbol in a POSIX bracket expression, multi-character collating elements need to be considered.
<p/>
In [re.grammar] paragraph 14:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The behavior of the internal finite state machine representation when used to match a sequence of characters is 
as described in ECMA-262. The behavior is modified according to any <tt>match_flag_type</tt> flags specified when 
using the regular expression object in one of the regular expression algorithms. The behavior is also localized 
by interaction with the traits class template parameter as follows: [bullets 14.1 to 14.4]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In none of the bullets does the wording handle multi-character collating elements in a clear manner:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>14.1 deals in characters.</p></li>
<li><p>14.2 deals in characters (<tt>traits_inst.translate</tt> accepts only a single character).</p></li>
<li><p>14.3 might handle a multi-character collating element; however, there is no specification of how 
such a collating element is to be identified from the sequence of characters. Additionally, the definition 
of primary equivalence class specifies that it is a set of characters (not of collating elements).</p></li>
<li><p>14.4 deals in characters.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
The ECMA-262 specification for <em>ClassRanges</em> also deals in characters.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
For a user to implement a regular expression traits class meaningfully, the relationship between the return value of <tt>traits_inst.lookup_collatename</tt> to the behaviour of the finite state machine corresponding to a regular expression 
needs to be better specified.
<p/>
From <a href="https://wg21.link/n4660">N4660</a> subclause 31.13 [re.grammar], <tt>traits_inst.lookup_collatename</tt> 
only feeds clearly into two operations:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>a test if the returned string is empty ([re.grammar]/8), and</p></li>
<li><p>a test if the result of <tt>traits_inst.transform_primary</tt>, with the returned string, 
is empty ([re.grammar]/10).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Note: It is unclear if bullet 14.3 in [re.grammar]/14 refers to the result of <tt>traits_inst.lookup_collatename</tt> when 
it refers to a "collating element"; and if it does, it is unclear what input is to be used.
<p/>
It is therefore unclear what the effect is if <tt>traits_inst.lookup_collatename</tt> substitutes another member of the 
equivalence class as its output.
<p/>
For example, when processing <tt>"[[.AA.]]"</tt> as a pattern under a locale <tt>da_DK.utf8</tt>, what is the expected 
behaviour difference (if any) should <tt>traits_inst.lookup_collatename</tt> return, for <tt>"AA"</tt>, <tt>"\u00C5"</tt> 
(where <tt>U+00C5</tt> is A with ring, which sorts the same as <tt>"AA"</tt>)?

<p>
In Toronto Saturday afternoon LWG discussed LWG <a href="2976">2976</a> which finishes the job of removing allocator 
support from <tt>packaged_task</tt>. LWG confirmed that, despite the removal of <tt>packaged_task</tt> allocators 
"because it looks like <tt>std::function</tt>" was incorrect, they wanted to keep the allocator removals anyway, 
in large part due to this resolution being a response to an NB comment.
<p/>
If we don't want the type erased allocator situation at all, then we should remove them from the remaining place 
they exist in <tt>&lt;future&gt;</tt>, namely, in <tt>promise</tt>.
<p/>
This change also resolves potential implementation divergence on whether <tt>allocator::construct</tt> is intended 
to be used on elements constructed in the shared state, and allows the emplace-construction-in-<tt>future</tt> paper, 
<a href="https://wg21.link/p0319">P0319</a>, to be implemented without potential problems there.
</p>

<p><i>[28-Nov-2017 Mailing list discussion - set priority to P2]</i></p>

<p>Lots of people on the ML feel strongly about this; the suggestion was made that a paper would be welcomed laying out the rationale for removing allocator support here (and in other places).</p>

<p>
The C standard says that the expression in an <tt>assert</tt> must have a scalar type, and implies (or at least allows) 
that the condition is tested by comparison to zero. C++ says that the expression is a constant subexpression if it can 
be contextually converted to <tt>bool</tt>. Those ways to test the condition are not equivalent.
<p/>
It's possible to have expressions that meet the C++ requirements for a constant subexpression, but fail to meet the C 
requirements, and so don't compile.

<p>
C++ says that <tt>assert(x)</tt> is a constant subexpression, but as it doesn't have scalar type it's not even a valid expression.
<p/>
I think either 19.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/cassert.syn">[cassert.syn]</a> or 19.3.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/assertions.assert">[assertions.assert]</a> should repeat the requirement from C that 
<em>E</em> has scalar type, either normatively or in a note. We should also consider whether "contextually converted to <tt>bool</tt>" 
is the right condition, or if we should use comparison to zero instead.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The presentation of section [syserr.errcat.derived] is currently somewhat problematic:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
It is not clear why this section exists and what it is specifying. Presumably, it is the subject of the phrase 
"in this subclause" of the sibling section [syserr.errcat.overview], but that's confusing (because this would require the 
interpretation of "this subclause" as the containing superclause). It would be an improvement to say "shall behave 
as specified in [syserr.errcat.derived]" in the introduction.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The current wording of [syserr.errcat.derived] requires that derived classes keep the <tt>name</tt> member function pure-virtual, 
making it impossible to have non-abstract derived classes. This appears to be an editorial error. Surely <tt>name</tt> should 
just not be required to be pure-virtual.
</p></li>
<li><p>
There seems to be no requirement concerning the <tt>message</tt> virtual member function.
</p></li>
<li><p>
We should use <tt>override</tt> rather than <tt>virtual</tt>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
I would welcome a short, introductory paragraph in [syserr.errcat.derived] that states (non-redundantly) that the following 
are requirements on users' derived classes.

The post-condition buffer sequence requirements mandate pointer equivalence. This means that a copies of buffer sequences must 
point to the same pieces of underlying memory. While this is appropriate for <tt>MutableBufferSequence</tt>, it is unnecessary 
for <tt>ConstBufferSequence</tt> and can actually prevent useful implementation strategies such as the following constant buffer 
sequence which avoids dynamic allocations:

<p>
The spec for <tt>&lt;algorithms&gt;</tt> <tt>pop_heap</tt> includes
</p>
<blockquote><p>
-1- <i>Requires:</i> The range <tt>[first, last)</tt> shall be a valid non-empty heap.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This has the unfortunate consequence that to pop a value and push a new value is substantially less efficient than necessary. 
The popped value must be extracted by <tt>pop_heap</tt> (using up to 2 log <tt><i>N</i></tt> compares and swaps), and then, in 
<tt>push_heap</tt>, the new value must be inserted (for up to <tt><i>N</i></tt> compares and swaps, but more usually something 
like log <tt><i>N</i></tt>).
<p/>
Simply relaxing the requirement to
</p>
<blockquote><p>
-1- <i>Requires:</i> The range <tt>[first, last - 1)</tt> shall be a valid heap.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
enables use of <tt>pop_heap</tt> in an integrated push-and-pop operation, with less than half the number of expected compare 
and swap operations. Furthermore, if, as is often the case, the newly pushed value would have ended up at position <tt>first</tt>, 
the push/pop operation could complete in time <tt>&#x1d4aa;(1)</tt>, instead of (3 log <tt><i>N</i></tt>).
<p/>
The effect of the proposed relaxation on existing library implementations would be minimal in the extreme, and on existing user 
code nil. The base algorithm code remains exactly identical. The only changes needed would be to any instrumentation in a 
debugging version of the library, which would just need to relax its check, and to test suites that should exercise the newly 
tolerated input.
<p/>
Users today are tempted to get the improved performance by relying on existing implementations' tacit tolerance of input that 
only satisfies the proposed, relaxed requirements. In fact, the 
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/pop_heap">cppreference.com page on <tt>pop_heap</tt></a> offers no hint 
that this usage is not already allowed. This change would bless such reliance as formally permitted.
<p/>
After this change, minor extensions to <tt>std::priority_queue</tt> would enable it to take advantage of the newly efficient operation, 
perhaps:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void pop_push(const Type&amp;);
void pop_push(Type&amp;&amp;);
template &lt;class... Args&gt; void pop_emplace(Args&amp;&amp;... args);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
These will appear in a formal proposal if the resolution is accepted.

<h3><a name="3044" href="3044">3044.</a> Strange specification of <tt>max_size()</tt> for an allocator</h3>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Table 31 in the C++17 standard specifies <tt>X::max_size()</tt> (where <tt>X</tt> is an allocator type) as "The largest value 
that can meaningfully be passed to <tt>X::allocate()</tt>". Noticeably missing is the statement "<i>Throws:</i> Nothing".
<p/>
As an example of why this is an issue, note that <tt>vector::max_size()</tt> and <tt>allocator_traits::max_size()</tt> are 
both marked <tt>noexcept</tt>. We must then interpret <tt>max_size()</tt> as being allowed to sometimes call 
<tt>std::terminate</tt>, or else <tt>{vector, allocator_traits, ...}::max_size()</tt> must be allowed to directly calculate 
<tt>numeric_limits&lt;size_type&gt;::max() / sizeof(value_type)</tt> instead of querying the allocator, even if 
<tt>Alloc::max_size()</tt> exists. This seems like a bug in the wording for the requirements of <tt>max_size()</tt> in an 
allocator type. I think an issue should be opened on this subject to add <i>Throws:</i> Nothing or similar to the requirements 
of <tt>max_size()</tt> for an allocator.
<p/>
As an example consider writing up a framework to test the exception-safety of types in a given framework, since they were all 
written in an exception-free environment. One of the types in the framework is an allocator which, in a controlled way, 
can throw an exception at any point where it is allowed by the standard. It's important that the test framework be as pedantic 
as possible, so the allocator type throws on <tt>max_size()</tt>, since it is currently allowed to by the standard. When a 
reasonable <tt>vector</tt> implementation (at least those in libstdc++ and msvc) is, for example, asked to construct a 
<tt>vector</tt> from an <tt>initializer_list</tt>, it will call <tt>allocator_traits&lt;Alloc&gt;::max_size()</tt>, which will 
terminate the program because the exception thrown in <tt>Alloc::max_size()</tt> propagated through the <tt>noexcept</tt> 
traits function. Although this is conformant behavior, I think it's a bug in the standard that a function as benign as 
<tt>max_size()</tt> can terminate the program in this manner, and I think the fix is that a conformant allocator should be 
required to supply a non-throwing <tt>max_size()</tt> member function.
<p/>
Daniel:
<p/>
This problem was shortly discussed during review of LWG <a href="2162">2162</a> (see comment 2012-08-05). At that time
the more drastic but also more consistent requirement that an allocator's <tt>max_size</tt> function shall not throw
exceptions has not been added. IMO this position should be reconsidered to follow the spirit of the new issue LWG 
<a href="3044">3044</a>.
</p>

<p><i>[2018-01; Priority set to 3 after mailing list discussion]</i></p>


<p><i>[2018-08-21, Jonathan comments and provides wording]</i></p>

<p>
The phrase "the largest value that can meaningfully be passed to <tt>X::allocate()</tt>" is meaningless. Is it a 
requirement on the caller, so that larger values must not be passed? Or a hint from the allocator implementor that larger 
values will produce a <tt>bad_alloc</tt> exception? Can the return value change dynamically, based on the free memory
available to the allocator?! &mdash; LWG <a href="197">197</a> says it can't change.
<p/>
As noted in the LWG <a href="2162">2162</a> comments, we don't currently guarantee it can be called on a <tt>const</tt> object 
(so <tt>allocator_traits</tt> will not use the allocator's <tt>max_size()</tt> if it's non-<tt>const</tt>, although that was 
unclear before DR <a href="2284">2284</a>). In addition to adding "<i>Throws:</i> nothing" we should ensure it's callable 
on <tt>const</tt> lvalues, and clarify what "meaningfully" means and who is supposed to care about it. My proposed 
resolution doesn't achieve all of this, but is a start.

<p>
[refwrap] says that <tt>reference_wrapper&lt;T&gt;</tt> is a "wrapper around a reference to an object or function of type <tt>T</tt>" 
but this doesn't actually constrain it, and doesn't forbid non-referenceable function types like <tt>int() const</tt>.
<p/>
There is no way to construct a <tt>reference_wrapper&lt;int() const&gt;</tt> but implementations are required to provide partial 
specializations for functions with <i>cv</i>-qualifiers and ref-qualifiers in order to define a nested <tt>result_type</tt>. 
It should be undefined to instantiate <tt>reference_wrapper&lt;T&gt;</tt> with a non-referenceable type, or with a reference type 
(since references to references are not possible). Making it undefined (rather than ill-formed or unspecified) means implementations 
are not required to diagnose such invalid specializations, but also don't have to go to the effort of supporting weak result types etc.

</blockquote>

<p><i>[2019-03-15; Daniel comments and provides revised wording]</i></p>

<p>
The current wording is now far behind the working draft and a synchronization is therefore recommended. In particular, with the
acceptance of <a href="https://wg21.link/p0357r1">P0357R1</a>, the specification of <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> has no longer any
<i>weak result type</i>. Second, I would like to concur with a <a href="http://lists.isocpp.org/lib/2017/12/5023.php">remark 
from Tomasz</a> to change the wording to replace the undefined behavior by an ill-formed program instead, because <em>every</em>
attempt to instantiate the definition of <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> will instantiate its member declarations, and this would
cause the program to become ill-formed anyway because of the illegal formation of references to non-referenceable function 
types for member functions such as <tt>T&amp; get() const noexcept</tt>.
<p/>
As concrete wording suggestion I would recommend wording that ensures that an ill-formed program is only required when a
specialization of <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> is instantiated, because in the absence of a constrained template parameter
we shouldn't require implementations to diagnose even forming the name of a <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> specialization such 
as in the following example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
using X = reference_wrapper&lt;int() const&gt;;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The wording below does not take advantage of a <i>Mandates:</i> element to prevent a dependency on LWG <a href="3193">3193</a>
and because such an element is rarely used to specify class templates. If the committee wishes to use such an element, 
the equivalent wording would be:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Mandates:</i> <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> is instantiated with a referenceable type (3.45 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/defns.referenceable">[defns.referenceable]</a>) 
as the argument for the template parameter <tt>T</tt>.

Given <tt>atomic&lt;int&gt; meow{INT_MAX};</tt>, <tt>meow.fetch_add(1)</tt> has well-defined behavior because 33.5.8.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.types.int">[atomics.types.int]</a> p7 says that
<blockquote>

but <tt>meow += 1</tt> and <tt>++meow</tt> have undefined behavior, because these operator functions are defined (by, respectively, 
33.5.8.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.types.int">[atomics.types.int]</a> p8 and 33.5.8.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.types.memop">[atomics.types.memop]</a>) to be equivalent to <tt>return fetch_add(1) + 1;</tt>, 
and so the addition of 1 to the result of <tt>fetch_add</tt> &mdash; which causes an integer overflow in this case &mdash; occurs 
outside the protection of <tt>fetch_add</tt> magic. Additionally, the return value might differ from what <tt>fetch_add</tt> actually
wrote since that addition isn't required to use two's complement. This seems like a trap for the unwary. Is it intended?

<h3><a name="3049" href="3049">3049.</a> Missing wording allowing algorithms to use copies of function objects as substitutes for their parameters</h3>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
When designing the parallel algorithms library, we intended for parallel algorithms to copy their function objects parameters 
when it is possible and useful to do so, but there doesn't appear to be any wording to enable that latitude. To the contrary, 
algorithm specifications refer to their function object parameters by name, implying that a copy of the parameter may not 
be used as a substitute.
<p/>
This was noticed when Billy O'Neal observed that parallel <tt>generate()</tt> did not share parallel <tt>for_each()</tt> and 
<tt>for_each_n()</tt>'s special requirement for a <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> user-provided function object.
<p/>
This <tt>CopyConstructible Function</tt> requirement was added to relax legacy <tt>for_each()</tt>'s <tt>MoveConstructible Function</tt>
requirement to allow parallel implementations to make copies as necessary. All parallel algorithms need similar permissions, 
but a strong requirement for <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> in all algorithms is too restrictive.
<p/>
What we require is to allow algorithm implementations to use copies of function objects as substitutes for their original parameters, 
while not requiring that all function object parameters be copyable.
<p/>
Casey Carter noted that 27.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/algorithms.requirements">[algorithms.requirements]</a> p8 grants permission to all algorithms to copy their function 
object parameters. However, this paragraph is not normative and does not indicate how the algorithm is allowed to use such copies. 
Additionally, it does not specify which algorithm parameters are the ones called out as function objects. For example, 
27.7.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/alg.generate">[alg.generate]</a> refers to <tt>gen</tt> as a function object, but 27.6.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/alg.foreach">[alg.foreach]</a> does not refer to <tt>f</tt> 
as a function object. All the other types of callable algorithm parameters (i.e. <tt>Predicate</tt>, <tt>BinaryPredicate</tt>, 
<tt>Compare</tt>, <tt>UnaryOperation</tt>, <tt>BinaryOperation</tt>, <tt>BinaryOperation1</tt>, and <tt>BinaryOperation2</tt>) 
are defined to be function objects in 27.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/algorithms.requirements">[algorithms.requirements]</a> and 27.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/algorithms.parallel.user">[algorithms.parallel.user]</a>. This 
list intentionally omits <tt>Function</tt> and <tt>Generator</tt> by design.
<p/>
A potential resolution would introduce normative wording to explicitly allow algorithms to use copies of function object parameters 
as substitutes for their function object parameters, and remove ambiguity in algorithm specifications about which parameters are 
function objects.

<p>
(The resolution of #3 resolves part of <a href="https://wg21.link/p0488r0#page=10">C++17 NB comment US 36</a>.) 
<p/>
The handling of several options for <tt>filesystem::copy()</tt> is wrong:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Single-level directory copying is silently suppressed by any flag other than 
<tt>copy_options::recursive</tt> (even <tt>copy_options::directories_only</tt>). Single-level 
directory copying operates via using some unspecified flag to trigger this misfeature.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>copy_options::create_symlinks</tt> and <tt>copy_options::skip_symlinks</tt> affect 
the interpretation of the destination name; the latter shouldn't ever, and the former should 
affect only broken symlinks (since it would want to replace them).</p></li>
<li><p>The <tt>copy_options</tt> groups for existing target files and the form of copying are 
consulted only for creating regular files.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>copy("file", "dir")</tt> creates dir/file, but <tt>copy("symlink", "dir", 
copy_options::copy_symlinks)</tt> fails.</p></li>
<li><p>If a symlink is encountered with <tt>copy_options::copy_symlinks</tt> and 
<tt>copy_options::create_symlinks</tt>, the latter flag is ignored (but its otherwise sensible 
restriction to absolute paths applies) rather than the former.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>copy_options::create_symlinks</tt> without <tt>copy_options::copy_symlinks</tt> 
fails if it encounters a symlink. (This is particularly damaging for recursive operation.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
This issue, since it replaces so much text, also addresses two error-handling concerns in passing:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The significance of <tt>equivalent(from, to)</tt> failing is unspecified. (Ignoring such 
failures entirely would make dangerous those operations that replace the target with a link.)</p></li>
<li><p>Copying a directory involves several operations. When an <tt>error_code</tt> is being used, 
the process continues past errors and (because successful functions call <tt>ec.clear()</tt>) 
may suppress them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
This expands on the resolution for LWG <a href="2681">2681</a>.
<p/>
This also addresses the same issue as LWG <a href="2682">2682</a>, but has a different result 
(based on the fact that the Example successfully copies directories to new, non-existent names).

<p>Need to gather implementation experience; revisit in Kona. Status to Open.</p>

<p><i>[2018-11-13; Billy O'Neal comments]</i></p>

<p>
I (Billy O'Neal) prefer Davis' solution to LWG 3057, as I think the wording follows the meaning of the individual 
enum values more closely, and enables more scenarios to function correctly instead of reporting such cases as errors.
<p/>
However, I don't want to adopt that wording as is because it requires my implementation to detect errors in places 
that force us to do a bunch of extra system calls, and I don't believe those specific ways error handling happens 
is relevant to what the copy API wants to do.
<p/>
Ideally, the wording would be structured such that it said "here's a list of error conditions, if they happen we 
aren't going to tell you when exactly they are detected" and then listed the behavior irrespective of when errors 
happen. That way implementations can do the error checks when it makes sense according to what their system APIs 
report. For example, anything that requires symlink resolution is very expensive on my platform so I'd want to 
be able to defer anything related to status (rather than <tt>symlink_status</tt>) to after I've detected that 
there's actually a symlink (or junction) involved.

<p>
What are the requirements for
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
a = b;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
... where <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are of map-like associative container type (<tt>map</tt>, 
<tt>multimap</tt>, <tt>unordered_map</tt>, <tt>unordered_multimap</tt>)?
<p/>
The general container requirements say just:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
r = a  <i>// Postconditions: r == a</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
(Incidentally, earlier in the table, there is a clear error: the general container requirements permit 
"<tt>a = rv</tt>" for assignment from an rvalue, but "<tt>a</tt>" here is a potentially-const container. 
Oops.) Oddly. there are no requirements at all on <tt>T</tt> here.
<p/>
The allocator-aware container requirements add:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
a = t  <i>// Requires: T is CopyInsertable into X and CopyAssignable.</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
... where <tt>T</tt> is the container's <tt>value_type</tt>, that is, <tt>pair&lt;const key_type, 
mapped_type&gt;</tt>. Note that such a pair is not <tt>CopyAssignable</tt> for "normal" key types 
that disallow assignment to <tt>const</tt> objects. They also add:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
a = rv  <i>// Requires: if !POCMA, T is MoveInsertable into X and MoveAssignable.</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
... which has the same problem in the !POCMA case.
<p/>
The associative container requirements and unordered associative container requirements have a similar problem for assignment from an initializer list:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
a = il  <i>// Requires: value_type is CopyInsertable into X and CopyAssignable.</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Presumably these assignments are intended to actually work, but what are the intended constraints? 
Do we wish to allow implementations to perform node reuse for these map-like containers? 
Presumably yes, and if so, the <tt>key_type</tt> portion of the node must be assigned as well as the 
<tt>value_type</tt> portion (for instance, with whatever implementation technique is used to power 
<tt>node_handle</tt>) as we cannot assume that key equivalence (or, for <tt>unordered_*map</tt>, 
even key equality) implies substitutability.
<p/>
I think, then, that the associative container requirements and unordered associative container requirements should specify different requirements for the "<tt>a = t</tt>", "<tt>a = rv</tt>", and "<tt>a = il</tt>" for the map-like containers; specifically:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>for "<tt>a = t</tt>" and "<tt>a = il</tt>", we should require that <tt>value_type</tt> is 
<tt>CopyInsertable</tt> into <tt>X</tt>, and <tt>key_type</tt> and <tt>mapped_type</tt> are 
<tt>CopyAssignable</tt></p></li>
<li><p>for "<tt>a = rv</tt>", if !POCMA, we should require that <tt>value_type</tt> is 
<tt>MoveInsertable</tt> into <tt>X</tt> and <tt>key_type</tt> and <tt>mapped_type</tt> are 
<tt>MoveAssignable</tt></p></li>
</ul>
<p>
(And we should fix the general container requirements to constrain "<tt>r = rv</tt>", not "<tt>a = rv</tt>".)

The "<tt>a = rv</tt>" problematic is already handled by LWG <a href="3028">3028</a>.

<p>
All of the scan algorithms ([exclusive.scan], [inclusive.scan], [transform.exclusive.scan], [transform.inclusive.scan]) have language like "If <tt>init</tt> is provided, <tt>T</tt> shall be 
<tt>MoveConstructible</tt> (Table 23); otherwise, <tt>ForwardIterator1</tt>'s value type shall be
<tt>MoveConstructible</tt>.". However, the algorithms operational semantics require that that type 
be written "by copy" to the destination range, making support for move only types impossible.
<p/>
We probably need to examine real implementations of these things and see what requirements are actually 
necessary, as in general <tt><i>GENERALIZED_SUM</i></tt> and <tt><i>GENERALIZED_NONCOMMUTATIVE_SUM</i></tt> 
need to specify the type used to store intermediate calculations.

<p>
The parallel forms of the uninitialized memory algorithms in <tt>&lt;memory&gt;</tt> are
underspecified in two ways. First, they missed the change that all parallel
algorithms require at least Forward Iterators, even for input ranges. See
<a href="https://wg21.link/p0467r2">P0467R2</a> for more details.
<p/>
The second problem is that they do not have a separate specification to
the serial forms. This is a problem in two ways. First, there is no more
blanket wording saying a parallel policy algorithm has the same semantics
as the serial form unless otherwise specified, so in principle these algorithms
are totally unspecified. However, assuming that intent, all of the existing
specifications use an as-if formulation with code that is explicitly serial in
nature, so need a new specification that talks about the effects on each
element without including the iteration order.

<p>
A typical specification of the algorithms for initializing raw memory in <tt>&lt;memory&gt;</tt> looks like:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects:</i> Equivalent to:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
for (; first != last; ++first)
  ::new (static_cast&lt;void*&gt;(addressof(*first)))
    typename iterator_traits&lt;ForwardIterator&gt;::value_type;
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, this hides a nasty question:
<p/>
How do we bind a reference to an uninitialized object when dereferencing our iterator,
so that <tt>static_cast&lt;void*&gt;(addressof(*first))</tt> does not trigger undefined behavior on
the call to <tt>*first</tt>?
<p/>
When pointers are the only iterators we cared about, we could simply cast the iterator
value to <tt>void*</tt> without dereferencing. I don't see how to implement this spec safely
without introducing another customization point for iterators that performs the same
function as casting a pointer to <tt>void*</tt> in order to get the address of the element.

<p>
28.7.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/sf.cmath">[sf.cmath]</a>/1 uses the phrase "report a domain error" (emphasis mine):
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
If any argument value to any of the functions specified in this subclause is a NaN (Not a Number), the
function shall return a NaN but it shall not <b>report a domain error</b>. Otherwise, the function shall 
<b>report a domain error</b> for just those argument values for which:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the function description's <i>Returns:</i> clause explicitly specifies a domain and those argument 
values fall outside the specified domain, or</p></li>
<li><p>the corresponding mathematical function value has a nonzero imaginary component, or</p></li>
<li><p>the corresponding mathematical function is not mathematically defined.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
The behavior this phrase is attempting to convey is unclear. A quick search through the text of the 
standard for "domain error" finds only the <tt>domain_error</tt> exception type defined in 
19.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/domain.error">[domain.error]</a>. Is the intent of "report a domain error" that the special math functions 
throw an exception of type <tt>domain_error</tt>, or is it that they behave as specified in C11 
7.12.1 "Treatment of error conditions" para 2 which defines the term "domain error"?

<tt>variant::emplace</tt> functions in 22.6.3.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/variant.mod">[variant.mod]</a> destroy the currently

<p/>
This leads to situation, when move/copy assigning subobject from <tt>variant</tt> into the same 
<tt>variant</tt> corrupts data:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>

int main() 
{
  var_t v = str_ptr_t{
    new str_t{"Long string that does not fit into SS buffer and forces dynamic allocation"}

  // Any of the following lines corrupt the variant's content:

  std::cout &lt;&lt; std::get&lt;str_t&gt;(v) &lt;&lt; std::endl; // SEGV - 'str_t' inside 'v' is invalid

<b>Addresses: networking.ts</b>
<p>The <tt>DynamicBuffer</tt> overloads of <code>async_read</code> and <code>async_write</code>, and 
<code>async_read_until</code>, are underspecified with respect to the lifetime of the dynamic 
buffer argument <code>b</code>.</p>

<p>Asio's implementation (and the intended specification) performs <code><em>DECAY_COPY</em>(b)</code> 
in the <code>async_read</code>, <code>async_write</code>, and <code>async_read_until</code> 
initiating functions. All operations performed on <code>b</code> are actually performed on that 
decay-copy, or on a move-constructed descendant of it. The copy is intended to refer to the same 
underlying storage and be otherwise interchangeable with the original in every way.</p>

<p>Most initiating functions' argument lifetimes are covered by [async.reqmts.async.lifetime]. As 
an rvalue reference it falls under the second bullet, which specifies that the object is copied 
(but doesn't say decay-copied).</p>

<p>The proposed resolution adds a postcondition for <tt>DynamicBuffer</tt> move construction, and 
specifies that <code><em>DECAY_COPY</em>(b)</code> be used for each of these functions. The following 
two alternative resolutions may also be considered:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add an extra bullet to [async.reqmts.async.lifetime] to cover rvalue parameters (but specifically exclude CompletionTokens).</p></li>
<li><p>Change the <tt>DynamicBuffer</tt> arguments to be by-value. (And also change the corresponding synchronous operations to be consistent.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Suppose that we have a user-defined class <code>dyn_buf</code> that satisfies the DynamicBuffer 
requirements ([buffer.reqmts.dynamicbuffer]), and is additionally copy-constructible. The following snippet compiles, as expected:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
dyn_buf b;
net::read_until(my_socket, b, "\n");
</pre></blockquote>
<p>However, this next snippet will not compile, when it should:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
dyn_buf b;
net::read(my_socket, b);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This is due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>DynamicBuffer</code> template parameter being deduced as <code>dyn_buf&amp;</code>, and</li>
<li>the <code>read</code> overload being specified to not participate in overload resolution unless <code>is_dynamic_buffer_v&lt;DynamicBuffer&gt;</code> is <code>true</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This can fixed by changing the test to <code>is_dynamic_buffer_v&lt;decay_t&lt;DynamicBuffer&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>
<tt>strtod()</tt> distinguishes between overflow and underflow by returning a value that is either 
very large or very small. Floating point <tt>from_chars</tt> does not currently offer any way for 
callers to distinguish these two cases.
<p/>
It would be beneficial if users could migrate from <tt>strtod()</tt> to <tt>from_chars</tt> without 
loss of functionality.
<p/>
I recommend that floating point <tt>from_chars</tt> use <tt>value</tt> as an overflow-vs-underflow 
reporting channel, in the same manner as <tt>strtod()</tt>.
<p/>
My proposed wording gives <tt>from_chars</tt> the same wide latitude that <tt>strtod()</tt> enjoys 
for handling underflow. A high-quality implementation would likely set <tt>ec == result_out_of_range</tt> 
for underflow only when the nearest representable <tt>float</tt> to the parsed value is a zero and 
the parsed mantissa was nonzero. In this case <tt>value</tt> would be set to (an appropriately-signed) zero. 
It is worth considering giving <tt>from_chars</tt> this more predictable behavior, if library writers 
feel they can provide this guarantee for all platforms. (I have a proof-of-concept integer-based 
implementation for IEEE doubles with this property.)

<p><i>[2023-03-29; Jonathan adds further discussion]</i></p>

<p>
There are conflicting interpretations of "not in the range representable"
for floating-point types. One view is that 1e-10000 and 1e+10000 are outside
the representable range for a 64-bit double-precision <code>double</code>
(which has min/max exponents of -1022 and 1023). Another view is that the
representable range for floating-point types is [-inf,+inf], which means
that there are values that cannot be <em>accurately</em> represented,
but there are no values "not in the range representable". And 1e-10000 is
clearly within the range [0,<code>numeric_limits&lt;double&gt;::max()</code>],
even if we don't use infinity as the upper bound of the range.
Under the second interpretation, the result will be &pm;0.0 for underflow
and &pm;inf for overflow, but <code>ec</code> will not be set.
</p>
<p>
The current proposed resolution does address this, by making it clear
that <code>value</code> should be set to a very small or very large value
(with appropriate sign), but that <code>ec</code> should also be set.
The use of the word "overflow" for the integer overloads is a problem though,
because the result cannot "overflow" an unsigned integer type,
but can certainly be outside its range.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
It's unclear how different termination facilities in C++ interact (and how they interact with the C 
termination facilities). Individually some of these functions try to handle corner cases, but hilarity 
ensues when combined with each other. As a simple example, can an <tt>atexit</tt> handler call <tt>exit</tt>? 
If not, can it call <tt>quick_exit</tt>, and can then <tt>at_quick_exit</tt> handler call <tt>exit</tt>? 
Is it possible to install an <tt>atexit</tt> handler from an <tt>at_quick_exit</tt>, without strongly 
happens before, while handling a separate <tt>atexit</tt> handler (and what happens then)?
<p/>
The termination handlers and termination conditions I collected:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>returning from <tt>main</tt> calls <tt>atexit</tt> handlers.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>atexit</tt> / <tt>exit</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>at_quick_exit</tt> / <tt>quick_exit</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>set_terminate</tt></p></li>
<li><p>violating <tt>noexcept</tt> and other things that call <tt>std::terminate</tt> (see 
<tt>[except.terminate]</tt>)</p></li>
<li><p>violating exception specification</p></li>
<li><p>parallel algorithms leaving with uncaught exception</p></li>
<li><p>some <tt>std::signal</tt> such as <tt>SIGTERM</tt>, <tt>SIGSEGV</tt>, <tt>SIGINT</tt>, 
<tt>SIGILL</tt>, <tt>SIGABRT</tt>, and (maybe?) <tt>SIGFPE</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>set_unexpected</tt> (now a zombie)</p></li>
<li><p><tt>unexpected_handler</tt> (now a zombie)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
What's unclear is:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is termination handling a DAG?</p></li>
<li><p>Which thread(s) are termination handlers called on?</p></li>
<li><p>Is program termination Turing complete?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
I've written a sample program which exercises some of this, see 
<a href="https://github.com/jfbastien/terminator/blob/master/terminator.cc">here</a>.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In general requirements on a whole program, as opposed to a single translation unit, generally specify 
"no diagnostic required", since we don't want to require implementations to do multi-translation-unit 
analysis. However, 17.6.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/new.delete.single">[new.delete.single]</a> paragraph 11 says,
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If a function with a <tt>size</tt> parameter is defined, the program shall also define the corresponding 
version without the <tt>size</tt> parameter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is clearly not restricted to a single translation unit; should "no diagnostic required" be added?

<p>
All the copy algorithms have some kind of prohibition on having the input and output ranges overlap. 
<p/>
The serial version of <tt>copy</tt> says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
The parallel version of <tt>copy</tt> says:
</p>

<tt>copy_if</tt> says:

</p>
<blockquote><p>

<p>
But <tt>copy_n</tt> has no such requirement.
<p/>
I think it should. I checked the minutes of the LWG discussion from 2008 when this was added, and 
there was no discussion of overlapping ranges.
</p>

<p>What formulation do we want here? Is it sufficient to say "... shall not be in the range ..." or should we use the stronger "... shall not overlap ..."? Some <tt>copy</tt> variants use one, some use the other.  Should we be consistent? Issue <a href="3085">3085</a> is a similar issue for <tt>char_traits::copy</tt>.</p>

<p>
29.5.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.duration.cons">[time.duration.cons]</a> p4 says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class Rep2, class Period2&gt;
  constexpr duration(const duration&lt;Rep2, Period2&gt;&amp; d);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>

<tt>ratio_divide&lt;Period2, period&gt;::den</tt> is 1 and <tt>treat_as_floating_point_v&lt;Rep2&gt;</tt> is <tt>false</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
with this example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
duration&lt;int, milli&gt; ms(3);
duration&lt;int, micro&gt; us = ms;  <i>// OK</i>
duration&lt;int, milli&gt; ms2 = us; <i>// error</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
It's unclear to me what "no overflow is induced in the conversion" means in the above. What happens here:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
duration&lt;int, milli&gt; ms(INT_MAX);
duration&lt;int, micro&gt; us = ms;  <i>// ???</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
An overflow is clearly induced in the conversion here: internally, we'll multiply <tt>INT_MAX</tt> by 1000. But that 
cannot be determined statically (in general), and so can't affect the result of overload resolution.
<p/>
So what's actually supposed to happen? Are we actually just supposed to check that <tt>Rep2</tt> is no larger than <tt>Rep</tt>? 
(If so, what happens on overflow? Undefined behavior?)
<p/>
It has been pointed out by Howard Hinnant:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
This refers to the compile-time conversion factor to convert <tt>Period2</tt> to <tt>Period</tt>. If that conversion factor 
is not representable as a (reduced) <tt>ratio&lt;N, D&gt;</tt>, then the constructor is SFINAE'd out. This might happen 
(for example) converting years to picoseconds.
</blockquote>
<p>
I would not have guessed that from the wording. Maybe replacing "no overflow is induced in the conversion" with "the result 
of <tt>ratio_divide&lt;Period2, Period&gt;</tt> is representable as a <tt>ratio</tt>" or similar would help?

<p>
Since the result of the <tt>ratio_divide</tt> has to be a <tt>ratio</tt>,
if it's not representable then the result simply isn't a valid type.
Implementations are not required to make <tt>ratio_divide</tt> SFINAE-friendly
to implement this constraint. They can perform the equivalent calculations

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
[bitmask.types] specifies the semantics of a bitmask type in terms of an "exposition only" <tt>enum</tt> definition, 
together with some constants and overloads. Notably, it is depicted as an unscoped enum, which implies among other 
things that it is implicitly convertible to <tt>int_type</tt>. At least some sources treat that as normative (as 
of this writing, <a href="http://cppreference.com/">cppreference.com</a>'s documentation for 
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/BitmaskType"><tt>BitmaskType</tt></a> says the expression 
<tt>(X &amp; Y) != 0</tt> is guaranteed to be well-formed), and it's hard to argue that they're wrong on the basis 
of the existing wording.
<p/>
On the other hand, many standard library types are depicted as scoped enums, but still specified to be "bitmask types". 
As far as I can tell, it's impossible in library code to make a scoped enum implicitly convertible to its underlying type, 
and even if you could, what would be the point? Presumably the specification of those types as scoped enums is intended 
to have some sort of observable consequences.
<p/>
In addition, some library types (notably in clause 31) are specified to be bitmask types, without indicating whether 
they are scoped or unscoped. It's not clear what the standard guarantees about e.g. whether they can be implicitly 
converted.
<p/>
I assume the intent is that "bitmask type" doesn't specify an implicit conversion, or any of the other ways unscoped 
and scoped enums differ, but the standard doesn't actually say that. We really ought to rewrite [bitmask.types] as 
a requirements table, but here's a quick hack to the existing wording as a stopgap.

LWG <a href="2192">2192</a> changed the library specification so that you always get all the <tt>std::abs</tt> overloads for fundamental

<tt>intmax_t</tt> if it's not <tt>long long</tt> (since LWG <a href="1449">1449</a>). Presumably that one should also follow the

<tt>strstreambuf</tt> refers to a nonexistent member function of <tt>fpos</tt> in the specification of the member function
<tt>seekpos</tt>, D.14.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/depr.strstreambuf.virtuals">[depr.strstreambuf.virtuals]</a>/18 (emphasize mine):

</p></blockquote>
<p>
The intent is clearly to get the corresponding <tt>streamoff</tt> from the <tt>fpos</tt>, as p19 says "the resultant 
offset <tt>newoff</tt> (of type <tt>off_type</tt>)". The mechanism to make that conversion is a normal explicit conversion, 
as indicated in the last row of the table in [fpos.operations].

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Paragraph citations relative to <a href="https://wg21.link/n4727">N4727</a>.
</p>
<p>
[stringbuf.virtuals]/10 says that <tt>newoff</tt> might be calculated from <tt>xnext - xbegin</tt>, 
or from <tt>high_mark - xbegin</tt>. After <tt>newoff</tt> is calculated, it does the null pointer 
check against and zero offset check. However, that means the effects may have already done 
<tt>nullptr -</tt> non-<tt>nullptr</tt>, or non-<tt>nullptr - nullptr</tt>, which [expr.add]/5 says 
is undefined behavior.
<p/>
Moreover, the attempt at avoiding this problem only tests <tt>newoff</tt>, not the value actually used 
which is <tt>newoff + off</tt>. For example, <tt>buf.seekoff(100, ios_base::beg, ios_base::out)</tt> 
on a read-only <tt>streambuf</tt> would try to assign <tt>pptr() + newoff + off to pptr()</tt>, but 
<tt>pptr()</tt> may have been <tt>nullptr</tt>, giving <tt>nullptr + 0 + 100</tt> which triggers UB. 
(Perhaps the "refers to an uninitialized character" bit protects that though).
<p/>
Last, the <i>Returns:</i> element says that it returns <tt>newoff</tt>, but then also says it returns 
the resulting stream position, which should be something like <tt>newoff + off</tt>. (I checked libc++ 
and MSVC++ and we both return <tt>newoff + off</tt>)
<p/>
We probably want to resolve that by renaming the value that comes out of Table 108 to something like 
"<tt>basis</tt>" and make "<tt>newoff</tt>" actually be the new offset instead of the starting offset.

The example in [fs.path.decompose] p7 includes:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
path("//host").filename();  <i>// yields</i> ""
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This result isn't guaranteed, it depends whether the implementation interprets <tt>"//host"</tt> as a <i>root-name</i> 
or as a <i>root-directory</i> (with a redundant <i>directory-separator</i>) followed by the <i>filename</i> <tt>"host"</tt>.
<p/>
The example should make it clear that this interpretation is allowed.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
LWG <a href="2939">2939</a> suggests that the the preconditions of the type traits need reevaluation.
This issue focuses specifically on <tt>is_assignable</tt> and, by extension, its variants:
<ul>
<li><tt>is_copy_assignable&lt;T&gt;</tt>, equivalent to <tt>is_assignable&lt;T&amp;, const T&amp;&gt;</tt>,

<li><tt>is_trivially_copy_assignable&lt;T&gt;</tt>, equivalent to <tt>is_assignable&lt;T&amp;, const T&amp;&gt; &amp;&amp;
  /* magic */</tt>,
</li>
<li><tt>is_trivially_move_assignable&lt;T&gt;</tt>, equivalent to <tt>is_assignable&lt;T&amp;, T&gt; &amp;&amp;
  /* magic */</tt>,
</li>
<li><tt>is_nothrow_assignable&lt;T, U&gt;</tt>, equivalent to <tt>is_assignable&lt;T, U&gt; &amp;&amp;
    noexcept(declval&lt;T&gt;() = declval&lt;U&gt;())</tt>,
</li>
<li><tt>is_nothrow_copy_assignable&lt;T&gt;</tt>, equivalent to <tt>is_assignable&lt;T&amp;, const T&amp;&gt; &amp;&amp;
    noexcept(declval&lt;T&amp;&gt;() = declval&lt;const T&amp;&gt;())</tt>,
</li>
<li><tt>is_nothrow_move_assignable&lt;T&gt;</tt>, equivalent to <tt>is_assignable&lt;T&amp;, T&gt; &amp;&amp;
    noexcept(declval&lt;T&amp;&gt;() = declval&lt;T&gt;())</tt>, and
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
We note a discrepancy: <tt>is_copy_assignable&lt;T&gt;</tt> requires <tt>T</tt> to be a complete type, but the
equivalent form <tt>is_assignable&lt;T&amp;, const T&amp;&gt;</tt> <em>does not</em>. The requirement for
<tt>is_copy_assignable&lt;T&gt;</tt> seems sensible, since there's no way to determine whether or not the assignment
<tt>declval&lt;T&amp;&gt;() = declval&lt;const T&amp;&gt;()</tt> is well-formed when <tt>T</tt> is incomplete.
It seems that the same argument should apply to all of the above "assignable" traits, and that they must require that
the referent type is complete when given a reference type parameter to be implementable.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The library wording frequently uses the construction "type <tt>T1</tt> is convertible to type <tt>T2</tt>", 
but this is an undefined phrase.
<p/>
For requirements on user code (e.g. [tuple.rel]), it is unclear whether all expressions of type <tt>T1</tt> 
must satisfy the convertibility requirement, regardless of value category, or whether a single
value category is in view only.
<p/>
Consider:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
struct C 
{
  operator int() &amp;&amp;;
};

int main()
{
  int x = C(); <i>// prvalue can be implicitly converted to int</i>
  C c;
  int y = c;   <i>// lvalue can't</i>
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The library has an "<tt>is_convertible&lt;T1, T2&gt;</tt>" trait, but that checks convertibility 
only for a single value category, not all possible ones.

In C++03 <tt>strstreambuf</tt> was not copyable, because <tt>basic_streambuf</tt> wasn't copyable. 
In C++11 we made <tt>basic_streambuf</tt> copyable by derived classes, and <tt>strstreambuf</tt> 
doesn't define any special members, so it (unintentionally?) became copyable, with completely 
unspecified semantics.
<p/>
VC++ and libc++ make it movable not copyable, and libstdc++ still follows C++03, so it's neither 
movable nor copyable. Making it movable seems to be the sane option, and consistent with 
<tt>filebuf</tt> and <tt>stringbuf</tt>.

<p>
Asynchronous algorithms are started by a call to an <em>initiating function</em>.
When these algorithms are constructed from calls to other initiating functions,
the result is called a <em>composed operation</em>. For example, <tt>async_read</tt> may be 
implemented in terms of zero or more calls to a stream's <tt>async_read_some</tt> algorithm. 
For operations where the caller cannot easily determine ahead of time the storage requirements 
needed for an algorithm to meet its post-conditions, [networking.ts] introduces the

A dynamic buffer encapsulates memory storage that may be automatically
resized as required, where the memory is divided into two regions: readable
bytes followed by writable bytes. [buffer.reqmts.dynamicbuffer]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Signatures for algorithms in the technical specification which accept dynamic
buffers use forwarding references:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<i>// 17.10 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/networking-ts/buffer.async.read.until">[networking.ts::buffer.async.read.until]</a>, asynchronous delimited read operations:</i>

template&lt;
  class AsyncReadStream,
  class DynamicBuffer,
  class CompletionToken&gt;
<i>DEDUCED</i> async_read_until(
  AsyncReadStream&amp; s,
  DynamicBuffer&amp;&amp; b,
  char delim,
  CompletionToken&amp;&amp; token);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Because the initiating function returns immediately, and the associated composed operation executes later, 
it is necessary for the algorithm to manage the lifetime of the dynamic buffer. Guidance for doing so is 
given in the TS:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>13.2.7.5 Lifetime of initiating function arguments [async.reqmts.async.lifetime]</b>
<p>
1. Unless otherwise specified, the lifetime of arguments to initiating functions shall be treated as 
follows: [&hellip;] the implementation does not assume the validity of the argument after the initiating 
function completes [&hellip;] The implementation may make copies of the argument, and all copies shall be
destroyed no later than immediately after invocation of the completion handler.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Given the guidance above, the most sensible approach is for the implementation
to move or make a decay-copy of the argument. An implementation of the TS,
authored by the principal architect of the TS itself, does precisely that:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;
    typename AsyncReadStream,
    typename DynamicBuffer,
    typename ReadHandler&gt;
class read_until_delim_op
{
public:
    template &lt;typename DeducedBuffers&gt;
    read_until_delim_op(
        AsyncReadStream&amp; stream,
        DeducedBuffers&amp;&amp; buffers,
        char delim, ReadHandler&amp; handler)
    : [&hellip;]
      buffers_(std::forward&lt;DeducedBuffers&gt;(buffers))
      [&hellip;]
    {
    }
    [&hellip;]
    DynamicBuffer buffers_;
    [&hellip;]
};

template &lt;
    typename AsyncReadStream,
    typename DynamicBuffer,
    typename ReadHandler&gt;
NET_TS_INITFN_RESULT_TYPE(ReadHandler,
    void (std::error_code, std::size_t))
async_read_until(
    AsyncReadStream&amp; s,
    DynamicBuffer&amp;&amp; buffers,
    char delim,
    ReadHandler&amp;&amp; handler)
{
  // If you get an error on the following line it means that your handler does
  // not meet the documented type requirements for a ReadHandler.
  NET_TS_READ_HANDLER_CHECK(ReadHandler, handler) type_check;

  async_completion&lt;ReadHandler,
    void (std::error_code, std::size_t)&gt; init(handler);

  detail::read_until_delim_op&lt;
    AsyncReadStream,
    typename decay&lt;DynamicBuffer&gt;::type,
    NET_TS_HANDLER_TYPE(ReadHandler, void (std::error_code, std::size_t))&gt;(
        s,
        DynamicBuffer&amp;&amp;buffers,
        delim,
        init.completion_handler)(std::error_code(), 0, 1);

  return init.result.get();
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Given the semantics of dynamic buffers implied by the wording, instances of
dynamic buffers behave more like references to storage types rather than
storage types, as copies refer to the same underlying storage. This can be
seen in the declaration of <tt>dynamic_string_buffer</tt> which meets
the requirements of <b>DynamicBuffer</b>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;typename Elem, typename Traits, typename Allocator&gt;
class dynamic_string_buffer
{
  [&hellip;]
private:
  std::basic_string&lt;Elem, Traits, Allocator&gt;&amp; string_;
  std::size_t size_;
  const std::size_t max_size_;
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
A dynamic string buffer contains a reference to the underlying string. Copies
of a dynamic string buffer refer to the same string. Note that the dynamic
string buffer also contains some state: the <tt>size_</tt> and <tt>max_size_</tt>
data members. This additional metadata informs the dynamic string buffer of
the boundaries between the readable and writable bytes, as well as the maximum
allowed size of the total of the readable and writable bytes.
<p/>
When only one composed operation handles the dynamic buffer, things seem to
work. However, if a composed operation wishes to invoke another composed
operation and pass that dynamic buffer, a problem arises. Consider two composed
operations <tt>f</tt> and <tt>g</tt>, which both operate on an instance of
dynamic buffer. When <tt>f</tt> is invoked, it makes a copy of the dynamic
buffer and then calls <tt>g</tt> with the copy. At this point, <tt>g</tt> must
also make a copy. Copies share the underlying storage, but in the case of
dynamic string buffers each copy maintains its own distinct metadata. When
<tt>g</tt> has finished mutating the dynamic buffer and returns control back
to <tt>f</tt> by invoking the completion handler, the metadata in the copy of
the dynamic buffer held by <tt>f</tt> will not have the changes made by <tt>g</tt>.
<p/>
Another design problem caused by adding metadata to the dynamic buffer concept
is illustrated in the following example code:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class MutableBufferSequence&gt;
std::size_t read(const MutableBufferSequence&amp;)
{
  throw std::exception{};
}

int main()
{
  std::string s;
  assert(s.empty());
  try
  {
    auto b = boost::asio::dynamic_buffer(s);
    b.commit(read(b.prepare(32)));
  }
  catch(const std::exception&amp;)
  {
    assert(s.empty()); // fails
  }
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
While not technically incorrect, it may be surprising to the user that
the string contains additional value-initialized data which was not part
of the original readable bytes (which in this case was empty). The wording of
the dynamic buffer concept does not address this case.
<p/>
The solution we propose is to change the semantics of <b>DynamicBuffer</b>
to represent a true storage type rather than a hybrid reference with metadata.
Instances of dynamic buffers will be passed by reference, and callers will
be required to manage the lifetime of dynamic buffer objects for the duration
of any asynchronous operations. An additional benefit of this change is that
it also solves the problem of exceptions described above.

<tt>std::sub_match::compare</tt> can be called with a <tt>basic_string</tt> or a pointer to a null-terminated 
character sequence, but can't be called with a <tt>basic_string_view</tt>. To compare to a <tt>string_view</tt> 
requires either conversion to <tt>basic_string</tt> (with a potential allocation) or a redundant call to 
<tt>traits_type::length</tt> to calculate a length that is already known.
</p>

<p><i>[2018-07-02, Jonathan comments and completes proposed wording]</i></p>

<p>
To make the relational and equality operators for <tt>sub_match</tt> support string views I propose specifying 
the semantics, not adding another 12 overloaded operators to namespace <tt>std</tt>, in addition to the 42 
already there. This allows them to be implemented as "hidden friends" if the implementation so desires, or to 
retain namespace-scope declaration if backwards compatibility with C++11 - C++17 is preferred.

While undefined behavior is appropriate for the other cases specified in the earlier bullets, which
describe failure to meet (runtime) semantic requirements, "instantiating a template component or
evaluating a concept" with an incomplete type happens at compile-time, and could potentially be
diagnosed. It would therefore be more appropriate to specify that programs which do so are
ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

<h3><a name="3157" href="3157">3157.</a> Allocator <tt>destroy</tt> and fancy pointer operations must be non-throwing</h3>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In annotating things required to be called by <tt>~vector</tt>, Casey pointed out that several operations I guarded 
with <tt>noexcept</tt> aren't actually mandated by the standard to be <tt>noexcept</tt>. However, the STL, and more 
specifically here, containers, consider inability to destroy an element an unrecoverable condition. This is evidenced 
for the whole STL by 16.4.6.13 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/res.on.exception.handling">[res.on.exception.handling]</a>/3 "Every destructor in the C ++ standard library shall 
behave as if it had a non-throwing exception specification.".
<p/>
As a result, <tt>allocator::destroy</tt> and fancy pointer operations must be non-throwing for valid input, or the 
containers don't make any sense. This is obvious for things like <tt>vector::~vector</tt>, but less obviously the 
containers rely on these guarantees whenever inserting more than one element, etc.
<p/>
Moreover, we too narrowly specify the domain of the <tt>pointer_traits::pointer_to</tt> requirement in the 
<tt><i>Cpp17Allocator</i></tt> requirements, because any node-based container that uses container-internal sentinel 
nodes needs to be able to form pointers to said sentinel nodes; that operation must also be non-throwing.

20.3.1.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unique.ptr.single">[unique.ptr.single]</a> p1 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The default type for the template parameter <tt>D</tt> is <tt>default_delete</tt>. A client-supplied template argument 
<tt>D</tt> shall be a function object type (19.14), lvalue reference to function, or lvalue reference to function object 
type for which, given a value <tt>d</tt> of type <tt>D</tt> and a value ptr of type <tt>unique_ptr&lt;T, D&gt;::pointer</tt>, 
the expression <tt>d(ptr)</tt> is valid and has the effect of disposing of the pointer as appropriate for that deleter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
That means this is undefined:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;memory&gt;

struct IncompleteBase;

struct Deleter {
  void operator()(IncompleteBase*) const;
};

struct IncompleteDerived;

struct X {
  std::unique_ptr&lt;IncompleteDerived, Deleter&gt; p;
  ~X();
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<tt>unique_ptr::pointer</tt> is <tt>IncompleteDerived*</tt>, but <tt>is_invocable&lt;Deleter, IncompleteDerived*&gt;</tt> 
is unknowable until the type is complete (see LWG <a href="3099">3099</a> etc).
<p/>
The intention is that <tt>IncompleteDerived</tt> only needs to be complete when the deleter is invoked, which is in the 
definition of <tt>X::~X()</tt> for this example. But the requirement for <tt>d(ptr)</tt> to be valid requires a complete type. 
If the <tt>unique_ptr</tt> implementation adds <tt>static_assert(is_invocable_v&lt;D, pointer&gt;)</tt> to enforce the 
requirement, the example above fails to compile. GCC recently added that assertion.
<p/>
Do we want to relax that requirement, or do we want to force the code above to define <tt>Deleter::pointer</tt> as 
<tt>IncompleteBase*</tt> so that the <tt>is_invocable</tt> condition can be checked?
<p/>
The destructor and <tt>reset</tt> member function already require that the deleter can be invoked (and that <i>Requires:</i> 
element will be turned into a <i>Mandates:</i> one soon). We can just remove that requirement from the preamble for the 
class template, or say that the expression only needs to be valid when the destructor and <tt>reset</tt> member are 
instantiated. We could also rephrase it in terms of <tt>is_invocable_v&lt;D, unique_ptr&lt;T, D&gt;::pointer&gt;</tt>.

24.6.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/stack">[stack]</a> p1 says:
</p>
<blockquote>
Any sequence container supporting operations <tt>back()</tt>, <tt>push_back()</tt> and <tt>pop_back()</tt> can be used to
instantiate <tt>stack</tt>.
</blockquote>

<p>but then in 24.6.8.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/stack.defn">[stack.defn]</a> we have the following code:</p>
<pre>
template&lt;class... Args&gt;
  decltype(auto) emplace(Args&amp;&amp;... args)
    { return c.emplace_back(std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...); }
</pre>

<p>The same pattern appears in 24.6.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/queue">[queue]</a>.</p>

<p>I see two ways to resolve this:</p>
<p>The first is to add <tt>emplace_back()</tt> to the list of requirements for underlying containers for <tt>stack</tt> and <tt>queue</tt></p>

<p>The second is to replace the calls to <tt>c.emplace_back(std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...)</tt> with <tt>c.emplace(c.end(), std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...)</tt>. We can do this w/o messing with the list above because <tt>emplace</tt> is part of the sequence container requirements, while <tt>emplace_back</tt> is not. I checked the libc++ implementation of <tt>vector</tt>, <tt>deque</tt>, and <tt>list</tt>, and they all do the same thing for <tt>emplace(end(), ...)</tt> and <tt>emplace_back(...)</tt>.</p>

The constructor for <tt>std::system_error</tt> taking a single argument of type <tt>std::error_code</tt> is

<p>
From the wording, function pointers are never clearly considered. P1 infers
support for only objects, but it is not clear that wording is intended to be a
deliberate restriction, or is casual wording.
<p/>
Paragraph 2 mandates that we cannot instantiate for reference types, and do
support incomplete types, but still does not consider function types. Calling
out references specifically, as they are not object types, suggests the inferred
support for only objects in p1 is more a case of casual phrasing, than deliberate
intent.
<p/>
However, if we did intend to support function pointers, we may want to consider
adding a function-call operator, constrained to supporting pointer-to function types.
One other possibility is that the explicit conversion to <tt>pointer</tt> already serves that
purpose, although I need to double-check the core language that contextual
conversions to function pointer are considered when invoking the function call
operator.  If this <em>is</em> the case, then I suggest a note to that effect in
[memory.observer.ptr.conv] instead.

28.7.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/c.math.hypot3">[c.math.hypot3]</a> is only specified as "<i>Returns:</i> 
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msqrt><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo>
<msup><mi>y</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>z</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></msqrt></math>.". This is 
inconsistent with the 2-arg overload.
<p/>
It is not clear whether C's Annex F is "imported" into the C++ standard. [cmath.syn] p1 suggests that it 
is: "The contents and meaning of the header <tt>&lt;cmath&gt;</tt> are the same as the C standard library 
header <tt>&lt;math.h&gt;</tt>, [&hellip;]".

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Per <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/meta.rel#tab:type-traits.relationship">Table 49</a>
in 21.3.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/meta.rel">[meta.rel]</a>, the preconditions for both
<tt>is_convertible&lt;From, To&gt;</tt> and
<tt>is_nothrow_convertible&lt;From, To&gt;</tt> are:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<tt>From</tt> and <tt>To</tt> shall be complete types, arrays of unknown bound,
or <i>cv</i> <tt>void</tt> types.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Consequently, this program fragment:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
struct S;
static_assert(is_convertible_v&lt;S, const S&amp;&gt;);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
has undefined behavior despite that the actual behavior of <tt>is_convertible</tt>
specified in <a href="https://wg21.link/meta.rel#5">[meta.rel]/5</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
-5- The predicate condition for a template specialization
<tt>is_convertible&lt;From, To&gt;</tt> shall be satisfied if and only if the
return expression in the following code would be well-formed, including any
implicit conversions to the return type of the function:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
To test() {
  return declval&lt;From&gt;();
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>[ <i>Note:</i> &hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
is well-formed: <tt>declval&lt;S&gt;()</tt> is an xvalue of type <tt>S</tt>,
which certainly does implicitly convert to <tt>const S&amp;</tt>. We should
relax the precondition to allow this perfectly valid case (and similar cases
like <tt>is_convertible&lt;S, S&amp;&amp;&gt;</tt>), letting the cases that

<p>
The current working paper requires <tt>iterator_traits&lt;Iter&gt;::pointer</tt> to be <tt>void</tt> if <tt>Iter</tt> 
doesn't define <tt>operator-&gt;</tt> (25.3.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.traits">[iterator.traits]</a>). We recently removed <tt>operator-&gt;</tt> 
from <tt>istreambuf_iterator</tt> via LWG <a href="2790">2790</a>, therefore either its <tt>pointer</tt> member should be 
<tt>void</tt>, or there should be a partial specialization of <tt>iterator_traits</tt>. Do we want to change 
<i>unspecified</i> to <tt>void</tt> in the class synopsis in [istreambuf.iterator]?

<p>
With the acceptance of <a href="https://wg21.link/p1252r2">P1252R2</a> the committee decided to deprecate <tt>operator-&gt;</tt> 
of <tt>move_iterator</tt>, interestingly without mentioning what should happen with its current <tt>pointer</tt> typedef (which
is equal to the template parameter <tt>Iterator</tt> and thus never <tt>void</tt>). Effectively this is a very similar situation 
as for the here discussed <tt>istreambuf_iterator</tt> case and it seems attractive to me to solve both cases similarly. 
</p>

<p><i>[2019-10-30, Jonathan comments]</i></p>

<p>
Also, <tt>reverse_iterator::operator-&gt;()</tt> is now constrained and so not always defined, but 
<tt>reverse_iterator::pointer</tt> is defined unconditionally.

We don't require that the <tt>Compare</tt> template parameter can be invoked with arguments of the queue's value type. 
It seems like something we can use <i>Mandates:</i> for, since it'll be ill-formed otherwise. Something like 
<tt>is_invocable_r_v&lt;bool, Compare&amp;, value_type&amp;, value_type&amp;&gt;</tt>.

<p>
The new functions added by <a href="https://wg21.link/p0591r4">P0591R4</a> misbehave for <i>cv</i>-qualified types. 
A specialization <tt>std::uses_allocator&lt;X, Alloc&gt;</tt> will not match <tt>const X</tt>, so 
<tt>std::uses_allocator_construction_args&lt;const X&gt;</tt> will return a different result from 
<tt>std::uses_allocator_construction_args&lt;X&gt;</tt>. It makes no sense to construct <tt>X</tt> and <tt>const X</tt> 
differently, either the type wants to use an allocator or it doesn't. I think 
<tt>std::uses_allocator_construction_args&lt;T&gt;</tt> should remove <i>cv</i>-qualifiers before checking 
<tt>uses_allocator</tt>, so that it works consistently. 
<p/>
We could consider changing <tt>std::make_obj_using_allocator</tt> to also strip <i>cv</i>-qualifiers, but it's not 
necessary as C++17 guaranteed elision works even for prvalues of <tt>const</tt> types. We only need to make the 
construction args ignore <i>cv</i>-qualifiers. We don't want to make <i>cv</i>-qualified types ill-formed, because 
that would require users of uses-allocator construction to strip <i>cv</i>-qualifiers before using these functions, 
e.g. in cases like <tt>std::tuple&lt;const int&gt; t(allocator_arg, alloc, 1);</tt>

<p>
Instead of replacing these elements usages for these places by extra wording to reach the same effects I
recommend to update instead 16.3.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/structure.specifications">[structure.specifications]</a> to ensure that requirement-expressing elements
are defined in a way that it also allows to express requirements imposed on types by these elements to standardize
"existing practice".
<p/>
Considering details, it seems obvious that <i>Mandates:</i>, <i>Expects:</i> as well as <i>Requires:</i> are "suitable"
to be defined for types (With the acceptance of <a href="https://wg21.link/p1463r1">P1463R1</a> there are now also
<i>Mandates:</i> for types such as Table 65 &mdash; "Allocator-aware container requirements" for type <tt>allocator_type</tt>).
<p/>
For <i>Constraints:</i> the meaning would not be so clear: Should it mean that there is conditionally a type defined or not?
According to  the submitters knowledge there are currently no known examples for <i>Constraints:</i> to specify
constraint on types, therefore I'm suggesting to restrict this extension to <i>Mandates:</i>, <i>Expects:</i>,
and <i>Requires:</i> alone.

<p><i>[2019-03-15; Daniel comments and provides wording]</i></p>

<p>
During the preparation of the wording for this issue it was found that we should allow
<i>Remarks:</i> elements to be used for other things than functions. One example of imposed
restrictions can be found in 17.11.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/cmp.common">[cmp.common]</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class... Ts&gt;
struct common_comparison_category {
  using type = <i>see below</i>;
};
</pre>
<p>
-2- <i>Remarks:</i> The member <i>typedef-name</i> <tt>type</tt> denotes the common comparison type
(11.10.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/class.spaceship">[class.spaceship]</a>) of <tt>Ts...</tt>, the expanded parameter pack. [&hellip;]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The discussion of this issue speaks of "type" restrictions (versus the specified restrictions on
functions), because even the non-type template argument restrictions of 22.3.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/pair.astuple">[pair.astuple]</a>
appear in the context of a member type specification, but there are examples where not really a
single (member) type is involved, e.g. in the 22.4.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/tuple.helper">[tuple.helper]</a> example mentioned above.
<p/>
Another example is when such elements are used for the specification of template specializations, e.g.
in 22.4.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/tuple.helper">[tuple.helper]</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class T&gt; struct tuple_size;
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-1- <i>Remarks:</i> All specializations of <tt>tuple_size</tt> shall satisfy the
<i>Cpp17UnaryTypeTrait</i> requirements (21.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/meta.rqmts">[meta.rqmts]</a>) with a base characteristic
of <tt>integral_constant&lt;size_t, N&gt;</tt> for some <tt>N</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Besides class template specializations, a second relevant use-case is the specification of member types
(Which are not necessarily part of a template), typically within the requirement tables, e.g. in
Table 62 &mdash; "Container requirements"'s entry <tt>X::value_type</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Requires:</i> <tt>T</tt> is <i>Cpp17Erasable</i> from <tt>X</tt>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The suggested wording tries to cover the generalization by means of the term "non-function
entities" in addition to the existing functions to prevent being enforced to enumerate all entities
to which the extended rules apply.

<p>
MSVC++ (and apparently libc++) have asserts that <tt>std::prev</tt> only accepts <tt>BidirectionalIterator</tt>s, 
because it's declared in the standard as accepting only <tt>BidirectionalIterator</tt>. libc++ changed their tests 
(in <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/f51ee632475654a396f93da9d36841989e1c7742">this commit</a>), 
apparently from a bug report from Ville and Jonathan, saying that one could theoretically call <tt>std::prev</tt> 
with a negative number.
<p/>
The standardese in [iterator.operations] strongly indicates that <tt>prev</tt> requires a <tt>BidirectionalIterator</tt>, 
but I don't see the usual wording that connects template type parameters of that name to the <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> 
requirements or similar. So perhaps one could argue that the name <tt>Bidirectional</tt> there has no meaning. Even 
if that is the case, that's a defect in the other direction.

<p><i>[2022-04-22; Jonathan adds a comment]</i></p>

<p>
<a href="https://wg21.link/p2408">P2408</a> changes the requirements for
types substituting <tt>BidirectionalIterator</tt> etc. in the Algorithms clause.
We should consider whether that is appropriate here, especially as algorithms
might make use of <tt>std::prev</tt> internally.
An algorithm that was changed by P2408 to accept types that model
<tt>bidirectional_iterator</tt> instead of requiring
<tt><i>Cpp17BidirectionalIterator</i></tt> might have to stop using
<tt>std::prev</tt> if we don't resolve this issue to allow it.
</p>
<p>
We should consider whether <tt>distance</tt>, <tt>advance</tt> and <tt>next</tt>
need the same treatment.

<p>
<a href="https://wg21.link/p0898r4">P0898R4</a> "The One Ranges Proposal" added a new fallback case to 
the definition of <tt>common_type</tt> in 21.3.8.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/meta.trans.other">[meta.trans.other]</a>, bullet 3.3.4:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
Otherwise, if <tt><i>COND_RES</i>(<i>CREF</i>(D1), <i>CREF</i>(D2))</tt> denotes a type, let <tt>C</tt> 
denote the type <tt>decay_t&lt;<i>COND_RES</i>(<i>CREF</i>(D1), <i>CREF</i>(D2))&gt;</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Per para 3.3, <tt>D1</tt> and <tt>D2</tt> are decayed types. If both are <tt>void</tt>, bullet 3.3.4 
is not reached. If either is an abominable function type or <tt>void</tt>, the <tt><i>COND_RES</i></tt> 
type expression above is ill-formed and bullet 3.3.4 does not apply. In all cases in which the 
<tt><i>COND_RES</i></tt> expression is well-formed, <tt>D1</tt> and <tt>D2</tt> denote <i>cv</i>-unqualified 
non-array object types. Given that fact, (1) <tt><i>CREF</i>(D1)</tt> and <tt><i>CREF</i>(D2)</tt> 
are equivalent to <tt>const D1&amp;</tt> and <tt>const D2&amp;</tt>, respectively, and (2) the 
<tt><i>COND_RES</i></tt> expression is equivalent to <tt>decltype(false ? 
declval&lt;const D1&amp;&gt;() : declval&lt;const D1&amp;&gt;())</tt>, i.e., the second and third 
operands of the conditional operator are lvalues of type <tt>const D1</tt> and <tt>const D2</tt>, respectively.
<p/>
[expr.cond]/3 cannot apply since the operands are not glvalue bit-fields.
<p/>
If <tt>D1</tt> and <tt>D2</tt> are the same type, [expr.cond]/4 does not apply. If <tt>D1</tt> and 
<tt>D2</tt> are different types, there are a few cases to consider:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If [expr.cond]/4.1 applies, one operand is converted into an lvalue reference to the type of the other, 
i.e., both resulting operands are lvalues of type either <tt>const D1</tt> or <tt>const D2</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>[expr.cond]/4.2 cannot apply since neither operand is an xvalue.</p></li>
<li><p>[expr.cond]/4.3.1 cannot apply since it would imply that the operands have the same type.</p></li>
<li><p>If [expr.cond]/4.3.2 applies &mdash; if either <tt>D1</tt> or <tt>D2</tt> is a base class of the 
other &mdash; again the resulting operands are lvalues of type either <tt>const D1</tt> or <tt>const D2</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>If [expr.cond]/4.3.3 applies, the either the <tt>const D1&amp;</tt> operand converts to 
<tt>const D2</tt> or the <tt>const D2&amp;</tt> operand converts to <tt>const D1</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>If none of the sub-bullets in [expr.cond]/4 applies, the operands are left unchanged.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
[expr.cond]/5 applies if the operands initially had the same type, or in cases 1 and 4 above. The 
conditional expression is an lvalue of type <tt>const D1</tt> or <tt>const D2</tt>, and the 
<tt><i>COND_RES</i></tt> expression yields <tt>const D1&amp;</tt> or <tt>const D2&amp;</tt>.
<p/>
Only cases 5 and 6 reach [expr.cond]/6. This paragraph performs overload resolution, which may result 
in converting both operands to the same non-class type to invoke a builtin conditional operator "overload". 
<p/>
[expr.cond]/7 applies standard conversions including array-to-pointer and function-to-pointer conversion to the operands. Consequently, the operands are once more "decayed" if [expr.cond]/6 converted them to an array or function type. Again case-by-case:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>[expr.cond]/7.1 applies if the operands now have the same type, which is the type of the conditional 
expression.</p></li>
<li><p>[expr.cond]/7.2 applies if the operands have arithmetic or enumeration type; the conditional expression yields the result of applying the usual arithmetic conversions.</p></li>
<li><p>[expr.cond]/7.3 applies if the operands have pointer type; the conditional expression yields their composite pointer type.</p></li>
<li><p>[expr.cond]/7.4 applies if the operands have pointer-to-member type; the conditional expression applies some more standard conversions and yields their composite pointer type.</p></li>
<li><p>[expr.cond]/7.5 applies if one operand has type <tt>nullptr_t</tt> and the other is either a null 
pointer constant or has type <tt>nullptr_t</tt>; the conditional expression yields <tt>nullptr_t</tt>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
In every case above, the conditional expression is either ill-formed, an lvalue of type <tt>const D1</tt> or 
<tt>const D2</tt>, or a prvalue of a non-array non-function type. Consequently the <tt><i>COND_RES</i></tt> 
type expression always yields a non-array non-function type, for which <tt>decay_t</tt> and <tt>remove_cvref_t</tt> 
are equivalent. We can therefore replace <tt><i>COND_RES</i>(<i>CREF</i>(D1), <i>CREF</i>(D2))</tt> in
[meta.trans.other]/3.3.4 with <tt>decltype(false ? declval&lt;const D1&amp;&gt;() : 
declval&lt;const D2&amp;&gt;())</tt>, and replace the usage of <tt>decay_t</tt> with <tt>remove_cvref_t</tt>.
<p/>
Furthermore, there are now quite a few different cases describing the behavior of <tt>common_type</tt>. 
It's not clear that <tt>common_type&lt;T...&gt;::type</tt> is always a decayed type without in-depth analysis. 
We should non-normatively clarify that fact.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
I implemented the fix for LWG <a href="3008">3008</a> and Stephan pointed out there's an inconsistency here 
for <tt>allocate_shared&lt;const T&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
20.3.2.2.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared.create">[util.smartptr.shared.create]</a> p3 says that the allocator construct call is done without removing 
<i>cv</i> qualifiers, but 20.3.2.2.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared.create">[util.smartptr.shared.create]</a> p7.12 says that the <tt>destroy</tt> 
call is done with removed <i>cv</i> qualifiers.
<p/>
The fallback for <tt>allocator_traits::construct</tt> rejects <tt>const T*</tt> (since it <tt>static_casts</tt> 
to <tt>void*</tt>), so the most likely outcome of attempting to do this today is to fail to compile, which 
is a break with C++17.
<p/>
Our options are:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Fix the allocator model to deal with <tt>const</tt> elements somehow, which breaks compatibility 
with existing allocators unprepared for <tt>const</tt> elements here. We would need to extend the allocator 
requirements to allow <tt>const T*</tt> to be passed here, and fix our default to <tt>const_cast</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix <tt>allocate_shared</tt> to remove <tt>const</tt> before calling <tt>construct</tt>, which 
changes the experience for C++17 customers because <tt>allocate_shared</tt> constructs a <tt>T</tt> 
instead of a <tt>const T</tt>, but not in a way substantially different to edits 
<a href="https://wg21.link/p0674">P0674</a> already made here.</p></li>
<li><p>Back out <tt>allocate_shared</tt>'s interaction with this part of the allocator model (reverting 
this part of <a href="https://wg21.link/p0674">P0674</a> and reopening LWG <a href="3008">3008</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Go around the problem by prohibiting <tt>allocate_shared&lt;const T&gt;</tt>, which breaks 
existing C++17 customers.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Billy O'Neal argues that only (2) preserves the design intent <a href="https://wg21.link/p0674">P0674</a> 
while maintaining compatibility for most allocators and most C++17 customers.
<p/>
Peter Dimov argues that (1) isn't likely to break enough to matter.

<p>
30.4.3.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/facet.num.get.virtuals">[facet.num.get.virtuals]</a> paragraph 4 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"Digit grouping is checked. That is, the positions of discarded separators is examined for consistency with
<tt>use_facet&lt;numpunct&lt;charT&gt;&gt;(loc).grouping()</tt>. If they are not consistent then
<tt>ios_base::failbit</tt> is assigned to <tt>err</tt>."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
It's unclear what is considered consistent or not.
<p/>
Obviously if the expected grouping is "1,234,567" then an input of "1,234,567" is consistent. Libstdc++,
MSVC and Boost all consider "1234567" to be consistent with an expected grouping "1,234,567" (and it
looks like libc++ is going to agree soon). That can be justified by saying that there are no discarded
separators to examine, so no inconsistency. But what about "1234,567"? There is only one discarded
separator here, and its position is consistent with the expected format.
<p/>
The wording should clarify that if there are no separators at all, that is OK. If there are one or more
separators then they must be at the expected positions, and there must not be any missing.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In 22.6.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/variant.ctor">[variant.ctor]</a> p5, we say:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Remarks:</i> This function shall be <tt>constexpr</tt> if and only if the value-initialization of
the alternative type <tt>T<sub>0</sub></tt> would satisfy the requirements for a constexpr function.
[&hellip;]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
First of all, I find it confusing that we say "This function shall be <tt>constexpr</tt> if [&hellip;]",
when the declaration of the function clearly has the <tt>constexpr</tt> keyword on it
unconditionally. Instead, I would use the wording "This function shall be usable in a constexpr context
if [&hellip;]".
<p/>
Secondly, I think we shouldn't be using if-and-only-if since it restricts whether implementations can be
<tt>constexpr</tt>-friendly as an extension. Instead, it seems better to just say "if".
<p/>
Finally, I think the condition under which the function must be <tt>constexpr</tt>-friendly is not
something we can test for because it says "value-initialization of the alternative type
<tt>T<sub>0</sub></tt> would satisfy the requirements for a constexpr function", which doesn't imply
the value initialization can actually be be performed inside a constexpr context (for example the
default constructor could be <tt>constexpr</tt> friendly <em>but</em> not marked with the
<tt>constexpr</tt> keyword).

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The new <tt>allocate_shared</tt> wording says we need to rebind the allocator back to <tt>T</tt>'s
type before we can call <tt>construct</tt> or <tt>destroy</tt>, but this is suboptimal (might make
extra unnecessary allocator copies), and is inconsistent with the containers' behavior, which call
allocator <tt>construct</tt> on whatever <tt>T</tt> they want. (For example,
<tt>std::list&lt;T, alloc&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt> rebinds to <tt>alloc&lt;_ListNode&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt>,
but calls <tt>construct(T*)</tt> without rebinding back)
<p/>
It seems like we should be consistent with the containers and not require a rebind here. PR would
look something like this, relative to N4810; I'm still not super happy with this wording because
it looks like it might be saying a copy of the allocator must be made we would like to avoid&hellip;

<h3><a name="3220" href="3220">3220.</a> P0558 broke conforming C++14 uses of atomic <tt>shared_ptr</tt></h3>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
This well-formed C++14 program:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;atomic&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;

struct Abstract { virtual void test() = 0; };
struct Concrete : Abstract { virtual void test() override {} };

int main() {
  std::shared_ptr&lt;Abstract&gt; ptr;
  std::atomic_store&lt;Abstract&gt;(&amp;ptr, std::make_shared&lt;Concrete&gt;());
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
is ill-formed in C++17. <a href="https://wg21.link/p0558">P0558</a> changed the non-member
non-<tt>shared_ptr</tt> atomic functions to avoid deducing from their second argument,
e.g. C++14 <tt>atomic_store</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class T&gt; void atomic_store(atomic&lt;T&gt;*, T); <i>// #1</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
became C++17 <tt>atomic_store</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class T&gt; void atomic_store(atomic&lt;T&gt;*, typename atomic&lt;T&gt;::value_type); <i>// #2</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The program intends to call the "other" <tt>atomic_store</tt> from
D.23 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/depr.util.smartptr.shared.atomic">[depr.util.smartptr.shared.atomic]</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class T&gt; void atomic_store(shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;*, shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;); <i>// #3</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In C++14, the call expression in the sample program &mdash;
<tt>std::atomic_store&lt;Abstract&gt;(&amp;ptr, std::make_shared&lt;Concrete&gt;())</tt> &mdash;
selects overload <tt><i>#3</i></tt>; overload <tt><i>#1</i></tt> fails to be viable due to the
lack of conversions from <tt>shared_ptr&lt;Abstract&gt;*</tt> to <tt>atomic&lt;Abstract&gt;*</tt>
and from <tt>shared_ptr&lt;Concrete&gt;</tt> to <tt>Abstract</tt>. In C++17, overload
<tt><i>#2</i></tt> doesn't get to the point of considering argument conversions: when we try to
generate the declaration of the specialization for <tt>T = Abstract</tt> we must instantiate
<tt>atomic&lt;Abstract&gt;</tt> in order to substitute <tt>typename atomic&lt;Abstract&gt;::value_type</tt>,
but doing so violates the requirement in [atomics.types.generic] p1 that "The type of the template
argument <tt>T</tt> shall be trivially copyable"
<p/>
The fix is fairly straightforward since <tt>atomic&lt;T&gt;::value_type</tt> is always an alias
for <tt>T</tt>: for those non-member atomic functions with overloads defined in
D.23 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/depr.util.smartptr.shared.atomic">[depr.util.smartptr.shared.atomic]</a>, use a different form to require that <tt>T</tt>
in the type of the second parameter is non-deduced.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Ordered and unordered associative containers in C++14 contained an issue, which caused an ambiguity
while invoking <tt>std::map::erase</tt> when <tt>key_type</tt> of the map can be constructed from
the iterator. In this case both overloads <tt>erase(const key_type&amp;)</tt> and
<tt>erase(const_iterator)</tt> could be chosen.
<p/>
The issue LWG <a href="2059">2059</a> was reported and resolved in C++17 by adding an extra overload
for <tt>erase</tt> in ordered and unordered associative containers which accepts <tt>iterator</tt>
as an argument.
<p/>
C++17 also introduced new functionality for splicing ordered and unordered maps and sets.
One of the extensions allows to extract a node from the container by passing either
<tt>key_type&amp;</tt> or <tt>const_iterator</tt> to the <tt>extract()</tt> member function:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
node_type extract(const key_type&amp; x);
node_type extract(const_iterator position);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Providing these two <tt>extract</tt> overloads causes the same problem as for <tt>erase</tt>.
Consider the following example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;map&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

struct Key
{
  template &lt;typename T&gt;
  Key(const T&amp;) {}
};

bool operator&lt;(const Key&amp;, const Key&amp;) { return false; }

int main()
{
  using map_type = std::map&lt;Key, std::string&gt;;

  map_type m({ {Key(1), "a"}, {Key(2), "b"} });
  map_type::iterator it = m.begin();
  auto nh = m.extract(it);
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In this case, call to <tt>extract()</tt> is ambiguous, because the overloads which accept
<tt>const_iterator</tt> and <tt>key_type</tt> are equally good matches for the argument
<tt>it</tt>.
<p/>
Consequently, this issue can be resolved in the same way as for <tt>std::map::erase</tt>
by adding an overload for <tt>extract</tt> which accepts <tt>iterator</tt> as an argument.

<p>
16.4.6.13 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/res.on.exception.handling">[res.on.exception.handling]</a>#3 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Destructor operations defined in the C++ standard library shall not throw exceptions.
Every destructor in the C++ standard library shall behave as if it had a non-throwing
exception specification.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
However, types like <tt>pair</tt> and <tt>array</tt> have implicitly declared destructors,
where 14.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/except.spec">[except.spec]</a>#8 applies:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The exception specification for an implicitly-declared destructor, or a destructor without
a <i>noexcept</i>-specifier, is potentially-throwing if and only if any of the destructors
for any of its potentially constructed subobjects is potentially-throwing or the destructor
is virtual and the destructor of any virtual base class is potentially throwing.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
We can relax 16.4.6.13 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/res.on.exception.handling">[res.on.exception.handling]</a> to only cover explicitly declared
destructors because if they hold a user type where the destructor throws then we get UB
from 16.4.5.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/res.on.functions">[res.on.functions]</a>#2:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
In particular, the effects are undefined in the following cases: [&hellip;]
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:none">
<li><p>[&hellip;]</p></li>
<li><p>(2.4) &mdash; if any replacement function or handler function or destructor operation
exits via an exception, unless specifically allowed in the applicable
<i>Required behavior:</i> paragraph.</p></li>
<li><p>[&hellip;]</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
and the referred to UB happens before [res.on.exception.handling] could apply.

Quoting 16.4.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/using.headers">[using.headers]</a> p3:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"[&hellip;] and shall include the header lexically before the first reference in that translation
 unit to any of the entities declared in that header."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This suggests we may be able to use macros and typedefs (like <tt>size_t</tt>) declared in 
standard headers without the corresponding <tt>#include</tt>. Clearly that is not the intended 
behavior!
<p/>
I thought about replacing 'entity' with 'name', but the same name may occur with
different contexts throughout the standard library. I thought about "contents of that
header", but run afoul of the same function overloads (<tt>std::begin</tt> etc.) being declared
in multiple headers.
<p/>
It may be simpler to turn this sentence around, along the lines of:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"No part of the standard library shall be used in a translation unit prior to a including
or importing a header that provides that feature."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Even here, 'used' may be a problematic term of art. Perhaps "named"?

<p>
It appears that in a conforming implementation, all but one <tt>wait()</tt> call on a given 
atomic object may block forever, regardless of any <tt>notify_one()</tt> calls, because in 
principle every <tt>notify_one()</tt> call could be considered to unblock the same single 
<tt>wait()</tt> call. Common sense suggests (and David Olsen confirms) that the intent is 
for each waiting function call to be (non-spuriously) unblocked by at most one notifying 
function call, but as far as I can tell the words never say that.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
[allocator.requirements] does not mention the interaction between <tt>is_always_equal</tt> 
and allocator rebinding. As the result, a rebound allocator may have different 
<tt>is_always_equal::value</tt> to the original allocator.
<p/>
Further, for an allocator type <tt>X</tt> satisfying 
<tt>std::allocator_type&lt;X&gt;::is_always_equal::value == true</tt>, rebound allocators 
of <tt>X</tt> with same type are not guaranteed equal.
<p/>
Consider:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p><tt>X</tt> is used as an allocator for <tt>value_type</tt> used in a node-based container;</p></li>
<li><p><tt>Y</tt> is the rebound allocator type for the node type used in the implementation;</p></li>
<li><p><tt>b1</tt> and <tt>b2</tt> are values of <tt>Y</tt> from different allocator objects.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Then, <tt>std::allocator_type&lt;X&gt;::is_always_equal::value == true</tt> does not necessarily 
imply <tt>b1 == b2</tt>.
<p/>
Since some of containers in the standard have already explicitly relied on <tt>is_always_equal</tt> 
of allocators for their <tt>value_type</tt> (notably, in the exception specification of the move 
assignment), this can cause subtle problems.
<p/>
In general, the implementation of the move assignment operator of such a container can not avoid 
allocation for new nodes when <tt>!std::allocator_traits&lt;Y&gt;::propagate_on_container_move_assignment::value 
&amp;&amp; b1 != b2</tt>. This can throw, and it can clash with the required exception specification 
based on <tt>std::allocator_traits&lt;value_type&gt;::is_always_equal</tt>:

<p><i>[2023-01-08; Jiang An comments and provides improved wording]</i></p>

<p>
Exception specifications of some container operations (added by <a href="https://wg21.link/N4258">N4258</a> and LWG <a href="3778">3778</a>) 
are specified with the propagation properties of template parameter <tt>Allocator</tt>. However, for node-based 
containers and <tt>std::deque</tt> (and common implementations of <tt>std::vector&lt;bool, A&gt;</tt>), 
rebound allocators are needed to be propagated, and common implementations are currently detecting the propagation 
properties of rebound allocators.
<p/>
I think if the allocator provided as template argument and the rebound have different propagation properties and 
behaves differently on propagation, then it is difficult or impossible for implementations to follow the current 
exception specifications.

<p>
According to 30.4.6.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/locale.time.get.virtuals">[locale.time.get.virtuals]</a> p11:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires:</i> <tt>t</tt> shall point to an object
</p></blockquote>
<p>
[Note: In my "Mandates" paper, I changed this to "<i>Expects:</i> <tt>t</tt> points to an object"]
<p/>
Nevertheless, it's odd, and inconsistent. <tt>time_get::get</tt> does not have any such stated requirement, 
and it calls <tt>do_get</tt>. None of the other "time" calls in <tt>time_get</tt> have such a (stated) 
requirement.
<p/>
I believe that this requirement is redundant, that it is implied by the wording in P12 and P14.
<p/>
P12: "or until it has extracted and assigned those <tt>struct tm</tt> members"
<p/>
P14: "It is unspecified whether multiple calls to <tt>do_get()</tt> with the address of the same 
<tt>struct tm</tt> object will update the current contents of the object or simply overwrite its members."
<p/>
If the pointer is invalid (null, or points to unmapped memory, say), you've got UB anyway.
<p/>
All the other calls in [locale.time.get.virtuals] were from C++98. <tt>do_get_time</tt> was added in C++11, 
and p11 originally said "<tt>t</tt> shall be dereferenceable". 
<p/>
This was changed to "<tt>t</tt> shall point to an object" as part of the resolution of CWG issue 
<a href="https://wg21.link/cwg342">342</a>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The new C++20 iterator concepts use <tt>common_reference</tt> to constrain the value, reference, and 
rvalue_reference associated types in order to support proxy references (see 
25.3.4.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.concept.readable">[iterator.concept.readable]</a>).
<p/>
However, the C++17 iterators did not support proxy references, so the use of <tt>common_reference</tt> in 
25.3.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.traits">[iterator.traits]</a>/p2 is needlessly complex. The <tt>common_reference</tt> constraints can be 
replaced with simple convertibility requirements to a <tt>const</tt> lvalue reference to the value type.
<p/>
This fix has been implemented in range-v3.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
I am concerned by the wording around <tt>atomic&lt;T&gt;::wait()/atomic&lt;T&gt;::notify_one()</tt>.
<p/>
33.5.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.wait">[atomics.wait]</a> p4 requires that the thread that calls <tt>wait()</tt> observed a
value <tt>X</tt> prior to the value <tt>Y</tt> which results from a store that happens-before 
the notify in order to be eligible to be unlocked.
<p/>
I am not sure how to implement that.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
atomic&lt;int&gt; a = 0;

T1: int ra=a, read 0
T1: a.wait(0)
T2: a=42
T3: int ra=a, read 42
T3: a.wait(42)
T2: a.notify_one()
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The wording requires that <tt>T1</tt> is eligible to be unlocked, but not <tt>T3</tt>, as
there is not a write <em>after</em> the value read by <tt>T3</tt> that happens-before
the notify.
<p/>
However, both <tt>T1</tt> and <tt>T3</tt> are waiting, so <tt>T3</tt> may be woken by the OS.
Waking <tt>T3</tt> is allowed (<tt>wait()</tt> says it may wake spuriously), but waking <tt>T1</tt>
is currently required as it is the only thread "eligible to be unblocked".
<p/>
This requires <tt>notify_one()</tt> to wake <em>all</em> waiters, which defeats the purpose.
<p/>
I suspect we need to change 33.5.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.wait">[atomics.wait]</a> p4.
<p/>
How about:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"A call to an atomic waiting operation <tt>W</tt> on an atomic object <tt>M</tt> is
<i>eligible to be unlocked</i> by a call to an atomic notifying operation <tt>N</tt> on
<tt>M</tt> if
<ul>
<li><p><tt>N</tt> does not happen-before <tt>W</tt></p></li>
<li><p>There are no side effects <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt> in the modification order of <tt>M</tt> such
that <tt>N</tt> happens-before <tt>X</tt>, <tt>X</tt> precedes <tt>Y</tt> in the modification order 
of <tt>M</tt> and an atomic operation that observes the effects of <tt>Y</tt> happens-before <tt>W</tt>.</p></li>
</ul>
"
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This would allow <tt>T3</tt> to be woken in the preceding example, but prevent it
being woken in the following case:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
T1: int ra=a, read 0
T1: a.wait(0)
T2: a=42
T2: a.notify_one()
T2: a=69
T3: int ra=a, read 69
T3: a.wait(69)

<p>
24.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/sequence.reqmts">[sequence.reqmts]</a> paragraph 3 says that the names <tt>i</tt> and <tt>j</tt> denote 
"iterators that meet the <i>Cpp17InputIterator</i> requirements and refer to elements implicitly 
convertible to <tt>value_type</tt>". Ignoring for the moment that this is an occurrence of LWG 
<a href="3105">3105</a> &mdash; we really mean that <tt>*i</tt> and <tt>*j</tt> must be implicitly 
convertible to <tt>value_type</tt> &mdash; this requirement seems to be completely extraneous.
<p/>
The names <tt>i</tt> and <tt>j</tt> are used in three places in the requirements table:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The range constructors <tt>X(i, j)</tt> and <tt>X u(i, j)</tt>, which require that the 
container's value type is <i>Cpp17EmplaceConstructible</i> into the container from <tt>*i</tt>; 
implicit conversion is neither necessary nor sufficient.</p></li>
<li><p>The range insert overload <tt>a.insert(p, i, j)</tt> which also requires <i>Cpp17EmplaceConstructible</i>, 
as well as the capability to move elements around for <tt>vector</tt> and <tt>deque</tt>; again, 
implicit conversion is neither necessary nor sufficient. It <em>would</em> be useful / performant 
here to require that the container's value type is assignable from <tt>*i</tt>, which may have 
been the intent of the implicit conversion requirement &mdash; would doing so be too breaking?</p></li>
<li><p>The range assign overload <tt>a.assign(i, j)</tt> which requires both 
<i>Cpp17EmplaceConstructible</i> as above and that it can assign the result of dereferencing an 
iterator directly to the container's value type; again, implicit conversion is not useful here.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
We should strike the implicit conversion requirement since it is not useful and only serves to confuse 
readers of the Standard (see e.g. <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/issues/107">here</a>).

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
It seems incorrect that a container would invalidate anything as a result of being asked to erase 0 elements. 
This came up in a recent customer bug report against Visual Studio, where given a <tt>vector v</tt>, 
<tt>v.erase(v.begin(), v.begin())</tt> triggered a self-assignment of all the elements in the vector. 
<p/>
<tt>deque</tt> has language enumerating erasures of the first and last element which invalidate fewer 
iterators, and a fallback that says all iterators are invalidated, which seems to intend to be talking about middle-of-container erasures. However, erasing 0 elements isn't really a middle of container erasure.
<p/>
<tt>vector</tt> says that iterators and references are invalidated after the 'point of the erase', but when 0 
elements are erased it's unclear what that even means.
<p/>
We should say that erasures that erase 0 elements are no ops and be clearer about which elements are 
invalidated for <tt>vector</tt>.

<p>
This doesn't make sense. What is the value of <tt>state</tt> if we're at the beginning of a sequence? 
Is the fact that we say that it's initialized in that case supposed to imply that it need not be

<p/>
Perhaps this means "value-initialized" or "default-initialized" instead of merely "initialized"?

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The Standard leaves unspecified the <tt>capacity()</tt> of a <tt>string</tt> or <tt>vector</tt>, 
and <tt>bucket_count()</tt> of an <tt>unordered_(multi)set</tt> or <tt>unordered_(multi)map</tt>, 
constructed by move from an empty <tt>other</tt>.
<p/>
For a non-empty <tt>other</tt>, normative language in the Standard constrains the new object to 
use (mostly) the same storage as the other, by way of lifetime of iterators and pointers
to elements.
<p/>
For an empty <tt>other</tt>, there can be no such pointers or iterators. However, the empty 
container may have a non-zero <tt>capacity()</tt> or <tt>bucket_count()</tt>, and having reserved 
storage there, one naturally expects that storage to be delivered to the new object in the same 
way as if it had elements.
<p/>
Existing implementations, in fact, do move storage to the new container, provided it can be 
deallocated using the new object's allocator. It is likely that existing programs have come to 
depend on this behavior.
<p/>
The resolution proposed is to add language to the Standard specifying that, if the allocators 
of the existing and new container objects are compatible, the storage of the new object is the 
same as of the old, so that no allocations or deallocations are performed in the process, as 
existing implementations in fact do.
<p/>
This appears to affect only <tt>string</tt>, <tt>vector</tt>, <tt>unordered_set</tt>, 
<tt>unordered_multiset</tt>, <tt>unordered_map</tt>, and <tt>unordered_multimap</tt>, but any 
new container types may also need similar attention.
<p/>
Note that in the case of the hashed containers, the array of buckets appears not to be required 
to be moved, even when elements contained are. This seems to be a similar oversight; extant 
implementations do move the bucket array. The resolution should cover this case as well.
<p/>
It is expected and intended that the proposed resolution does not require changes to the behavior 
of implementations.

It seems that there are no requirements about dereferenced iterator's element type, that, apparently,

<p>
There isn't even a requirement that the arguments are iterators.
And <tt>assign(InputIterator, InputIterator, flag_type)</tt> is not
constrained to only accept iterators either, meaning you can call it with
two integers and call the
<tt>basic_string(size_type, char_type)</tt> constructor.
</p>

<p><i>[2022-04-22; Jonathan adds a comment]</i></p>

<p>
As well as requiring the reference type to be convertible to <tt>charT</tt>,
we might want to consider constraining these with <tt>forward_iterator</tt>

The problem was discussed <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/pull/3454#discussion_r348198610">here</a>:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
It seems to me that this is just one instance of a systemic problem in the library wording. This phrasing 
"initializes <tt>x</tt> with <tt>y</tt>" is common, but underspecified (and formally meaningless) &mdash; 
the library wording either needs to say what kind of initialization is performed, or specify an initializer 
(not an expression) with which to initialize. We should ask LWG to think about this; for each "initializes 
<tt>x</tt> with <tt>y</tt>" utterance, the reader should know what kind of initialization we mean.
<p/>
Looking at random through the library wording, the first case I found: 24.6.6.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/queue.cons">[queue.cons]</a>/1:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Effects:</i> Initializes <tt>c</tt> with <tt>cont</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The meaning of this depends on whether this is direct- or copy-initialization. (It's obscure, but if <tt>T</tt> 
is not <i>Cpp17CopyInsertable</i> into the container, it could be the case that one form of initialization 
works and the other does not, or that they both work and do different things.)
<p/>
Another random sample: 27.10.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/partial.sum">[partial.sum]</a>/2:

Again the difference between direct- and copy-initialization is observable here.

Perhaps the library should have blanket wording that when it says "initializes", it means by 
direct- or copy-initialization, and that it's unspecified which one you get (or something like that) &mdash;

</p>
<ul>
<li><p>add blanket wording defining what you mean when you say "initializes <tt>x</tt> with <tt>y</tt>" 
(e.g., it's unspecified whether copy-initialization or direct-initialization is performed) and make sure 
that that's what's intended for all uses, or</p></li>
<li><p>stop using the "initializes <tt>x</tt> with <tt>y</tt>" formulation entirely, and specify the kind

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
33.7.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.condition.nonmember">[thread.condition.nonmember]</a> p2 states:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects:</i> Transfers ownership of the lock associated with <tt>lk</tt> into internal storage 
and schedules <tt>cond</tt> to be notified when the current thread exits, after all objects of 
thread storage duration associated with the current thread have been destroyed. This notification 
shall be as if:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
lk.unlock();
cond.notify_all();
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
One common use-cases for the <tt>notify_all_at_thread_exit()</tt> is in conjunction with
<tt>thread::detach()</tt> to allow detached threads to signal when they complete and to allow 
another thread to wait for them to complete using the <tt>condition_variable/mutex</tt> pair.
<p/>
However, the current wording for <tt>notify_all_at_thread_exit(condition_variable&amp; cond, 
unique_lock&lt;mutex&gt; lk)</tt> makes it impossible to know when it is safe to destroy the 
<tt>condition_variable</tt> in the presence of spurious wake-ups and detached threads.
<p/>
For example: Consider the following code-snippet:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;condition_variable&gt;
#include &lt;mutex&gt;
#include &lt;thread&gt;

int main() {
  std::condition_variable cv;
  std::mutex mut;
  bool complete = false;

  std::thread{[&amp;] {
    <i>// do work here</i>

    <i>// Signal thread completion</i>
    std::unique_lock lk{mut};
    complete = true;
    std::notify_all_at_thread_exit(cv, std::move(lk));
  }}.detach();

  <i>// Wait until thread completes</i>
  std::unique_lock lk{mut};
  cv.wait(lk, [&amp;] { return complete; });

  <i>// condition_variable destroyed on scope exit</i>
  return 0;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This seems to an intended usage of <tt>thread::detach()</tt> and <tt>std::notify_all_at_thread_exit()</tt> 
and yet this code contains a race involving the call to <tt>cv.notify_all()</tt> on the created thread, 
and the destructor of the <tt>condition_variable</tt>.
<p/>
To highlight the issue, consider the following case:
<p/>
Let <tt>T0</tt> be the thread that executes <tt>main()</tt> and <tt>T1</tt> be the thread created 
by the <tt>std::thread</tt> construction.
</p> 
<blockquote>
<p>
<tt>T0</tt>: creates thread <tt>T1</tt><br/>
<tt>T0</tt>: context-switched out by OS<br/>
<tt>T1</tt>: starts running<br/>
<p/>
<tt>T1</tt>: acquires mutex lock<br/>
<tt>T1</tt>: sets <tt>complete = true</tt><br/>
<p/>
<tt>T1</tt>: calls <tt>notify_all_at_thread_exit()</tt><br/>
<tt>T1</tt>: returns from thread-main function and runs all thread-local destructors<br/>
<tt>T1</tt>: calls <tt>lk.unlock()</tt><br/>
<tt>T1</tt>: context-switched out by OS<br/>
<tt>T0</tt>: resumes execution<br/>
<tt>T0</tt>: acquires mutex lock<br/>
<tt>T0</tt>: calls <tt>cv.wait()</tt> which returns immediately as <tt>complete</tt> is <tt>true</tt><br/>
<p/>
<tt>T0</tt>: returns from <tt>main()</tt>, destroying <tt>condition_variable</tt><br/>
<tt>T1</tt>: resumes execution<br/>
<p/>
<tt>T1</tt>: calls <tt>cv.notify_all()</tt> on a dangling <tt>cv</tt> reference (undefined behaviour)<br/>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Other sequencings are possible involving spurious wake-ups of the <tt>cv.wait()</tt> call.
<p/>
A proof-of-concept showing this issue can be found <a href="https://wandbox.org/permlink/eUu3eiQbLl7JQKMm">here</a>.
<p/>
The current wording requires releasing the mutex lock before calling <tt>cv.notify_all()</tt>. In the 
presence of spurious wake-ups of a <tt>condition_variable::wait()</tt>, there is no way to know whether 
or not a detached thread that called <tt>std::notify_all_at_thread_exit()</tt> has finished calling 
<tt>cv.notify_all()</tt>. This means there is no portable way to know when it will be safe for the 
waiting thread to destroy that <tt>condition_variable</tt>.
<p/>
However, if we were to reverse the order of the calls to <tt>lk.unlock()</tt> and <tt>cond.notify_all()</tt> 
then the thread waiting for the detached thread to exit would not be able to observe the completion of the 
thread (in the above case, this would be observing the assignment of <tt>true</tt> to the <tt>complete</tt> 
variable) until the mutex lock was released by that thread and subsequently acquired by the waiting thread 
which would only happen after the completion of the call to <tt>cv.notify_all()</tt>. This would allow the 
above code example to eliminate the race between a subsequent destruction of the condition-variable and 
the call to <tt>cv.notify_all()</tt>.

<tt>ranges::advance</tt> (25.4.4.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.iter.op.advance">[range.iter.op.advance]</a>) and <tt>std::advance</tt> 
(25.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.operations">[iterator.operations]</a>) can be called with a negative count <tt>n</tt> when the 
iterator argument <tt>i</tt> models <tt>bidirectional_iterator</tt> (respectively, meets the 
<i>Cpp17BidirectionalIterator</i> requirements). In this case, they are specified to "decrement <tt>i</tt> 
by <tt>-n</tt>". If <tt>n</tt> is the most-negative value of a signed integral type, the expression <tt>-n</tt> 
has undefined behavior. This UB is unfortunate given that typical implementations never actually 
form the expression <tt>-n</tt>. It's nonsensical to describe the effects of a function in terms 
of an expression with undefined behavior, so we should either define the behavior or exclude 
this case via precondition.
<p/>
<tt>ranges::prev()</tt> and <tt>std::prev</tt> (25.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.operations">[iterator.operations]</a>) have a similar problem: 
<tt>prev(i, n)</tt> is equivalent to:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
advance(i, -n); 
return i;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
which has undefined behavior when <tt>n</tt> is <tt>numeric_limits&lt;T&gt;::min()</tt> where <tt>T</tt> 
is <tt>iter_difference_t&lt;decltype(i)&gt;</tt> (for <tt>ranges::prev</tt>) or some signed integral type 
(for <tt>std::prev</tt>). There <em>is</em> an implicit precondition here thanks to "<i>Effects:</i> Equivalent 
to" since the equivalent code has a precondition that <tt>n</tt> is not a most-negative value, so 
this wording is not defective. We could, however, define behavior for <tt>prev</tt> regardless of the 
value of <tt>n</tt> by duplicating the specification of advance and inverting the "direction" of the 
operations. We should consider doing so.

Curiously, <tt>locale</tt>'s copy assignment operator currently returns <tt>const locale&amp;</tt>. As Casey

We aren't aware of any reason for this to be <tt>const</tt>. (I observe that this hasn't changed since 
<a href="https://wg21.link/n1804">N1804</a> on 2005-04-27 and probably goes back to C++98; I suspect that 
when this was originally specified, copy assignment operators were relatively new, and conventions for 
them weren't rigorously followed.)

<p>
Although "implementation may select this type on the basis of performance, size,
quality, or any combination of such factors," but changing this typedef is an ABI-break
for implementations. Specifying per-thread engine to use this typedef results in losses
of performance, size, and/or quality.
<p/>
Since this type is not involved in <tt>randint</tt> facilities' interface (other than its member
typedef), the current specification should be relaxed.

This issue has been submitted, because the editorial change requests 
<a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/3521">c++-draft-issue 3521</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/pull/3528">c++-draft-pull request 3528</a>
has been rejected as not being editorial changes:
</p>
<p>
Currently given wording of 17.4.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/cstdint.syn">[cstdint.syn]</a>p2:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The header defines all types and macros the same as the C standard library header <tt>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
might be understood as intended: typedefs inside <tt>stdint.h</tt> and inside <tt>cstdint</tt> in namespace 
<tt>std::</tt> refer to the same types, but another interpretation could be, that it's understood as:
<p/>
Definitions in both files are done the same way (<tt>cstdint</tt> provides typedefs not in namespace 
<tt>std</tt>, because it would be a different definition than one in <tt>stdint.h</tt>).
<p/>
Also 16.4.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/headers">[headers]</a>p5 is non sufficiently clear:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[&hellip;] the contents of each header <tt>c<i>name</i></tt> is the same as that of the corresponding header 
<tt><i>name</i>.h</tt> [&hellip;]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
As it doesn't say what does "same content" mean. For example is an implementation allowed to do following:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
// __impl.h
typedef int __my_int;
namespace std { typedef long __my_int; }

// cname header
#include "__impl.h"

namespace std {
  typedef __my_int uint32_t;
}

// name.h header
#include "__impl.h"
typedef __my_int uint32_t;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
? 
<p/>
In this case typedef from namespace <tt>std</tt> and from global namespace refer to different types?
<p/>
Proposed change:
<p/>
Apply wording, that will unambiguously make typedefs from namespace <tt>std</tt> refer to the same types 
as typedefs from global namespace for all headers <tt><i>name</i>.h</tt> and their corresponding headers 
<tt>c<i>name</i></tt>.

<tt>const</tt>/<tt>volatile</tt>/<tt>const volatile</tt> partial specializations of <tt>tuple_element</tt> 
available when any of those same headers is included. This leads to a couple of problems:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>For users of the Standard Library, it's not helpful to have these partial specializations of class 
templates available when the preferred interface &mdash; the variable template <tt>tuple_size_v</tt> and 
alias template <tt>tuple_element_t</tt> &mdash; are not.</p></li>
<li><p>For specifiers of the Standard Library, we must update two distinct yet identical lists of headers 
that make this same set of templates available when adding another header.</p></li></ol>
<p>
We could solve both of these problems by coalescing the two paragraphs into one and including the variable 
and alias template in the set of declarations made available by the pertinent (now single) list of headers.

<p>
This issue was submitted after a previous <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/3576">editorial 
change request</a> had been rejected by the project editors.
<p/>
I find that all known implementations (at least 
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/master/stl/inc/type_traits#L1658">msvcstl</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/libcxx/blob/master/include/type_traits#L1506">libc++</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/std/type_traits#L1458">libstdc++</a> and the sample in <a href="https://wg21.link/p0758r1#Appendix">P0758R1</a>) of <tt>std::is_nothrow_convertible</tt>
may be not clear enough to indicate that whether destruction of the destination type is considered (or not).
<p/>
For example, given a type <tt>Weird</tt> defined as
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct Weird 
{
  Weird(int) noexcept {}
  ~Weird() noexcept(false) {}
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Then <tt>std::is_nothrow_convertible_v&lt;int, Weird&gt;</tt> is <tt>false</tt> in every known implementation. 
However, it seems that the conversion itself is <tt>noexcept</tt>.

We have quite a few occurrences of the phrase "as if by" in <i>Effects:</i> elements in the 
library specification. Is the meaning of this phrase the same as "equivalent to"? If so, we 
should replace occurrences of "as if by" with "equivalent to" to make it clear that the magic 
"<i>Effects:</i> Equivalent to" wording in 16.3.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/structure.specifications">[structure.specifications]</a> para 4

<p>
This issue has been created because a corresponding 
<a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/3606">editorial change request</a> had been rejected.
<p/>
The resolution of LWG <a href="2406">2406</a> added a note to the definition of <tt>negative_binomial_distribution</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
[<i>Note</i>: This implies that <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
<mi>P</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>|</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow> 
</math> is undefined when <tt>p == 1</tt>. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This issue argues that the note is invalid as are the premises on which LWG 2406 was based 
on. It's also argued that current normative standard text allowing <tt>p == 1</tt> is valid 
both conceptually and mathematically, and that it follows existing conventions in other software.
<p/>
Problems with the added note:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Why does <tt>p == 1</tt> imply that <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
<mi>P</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>|</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow> 
</math> is undefined? The only questionable factor in the definition of 
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>P</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>|</mo>
<mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></math> seems to be that in case of 
<tt>p == 1</tt>, the factor <tt>(1 - p)<sup>i</sup></tt> leads to <tt>0<sup>0</sup></tt> 
when <tt>i == 0</tt>. While it is true that there's 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_the_power_of_zero">no generally accepted convention</a> 
what this means, <tt>std::binomial_distribution</tt> already uses the common convention 
<tt>0<sup>0</sup> == 1</tt> (e.g. with <tt>p == 1 &amp;&amp; t == i</tt>, 
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
<mi>P</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>|</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow> 
</math> leads to <tt>0<sup>0</sup></tt>)</p></li>
<li><p>Even if the term was undefined mathematically, does a non-normative note of
mathematical term being undefined mean that the behaviour of the program is
undefined (instead of e.g. resulting to NaN) even when no preconditions are violated?</p></li>
<li><p>The note has lead to unclear situation of being able to construct a
distribution object, but calling <tt>operator()</tt> might lead to undefined behaviour
even though no preconditions are violated: for example the 
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/numeric/random/negative_binomial_distribution/negative_binomial_distribution&amp;oldid=102755">cppreference.com notes</a> that 
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
If <tt>p == 1</tt>, subsequent calls to the <tt>operator()</tt> overload that does not
accept a <tt>param_type</tt> object will cause undefined behavior.
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Invalidity of premises of LWG 2406:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">

I cannot find any mention of this in the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Negative_binomial_distribution&amp;oldid=611204120">Wikipedia's
version as of 2014-06-02</a> (i.e. around the time when LWG 2406 was opened). Note that 
the Wikipedia's version is not the same as in C++ standard; in Wikipedia, <tt>p</tt> 
parameter is the same &mdash; i.e. the probability of success &mdash; but the integer parameter 
(<tt>&gt; 0</tt>) is <em>number of failures</em>, while in C++ it is the <em>number of successes</em>. 
In the failure formulation <tt>p == 1</tt> is indeed invalid for essentially the same reason why 
<tt>p == 0</tt> is invalid for the C++ definition (i.e. leads to 
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
<mi>P</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>|</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(from <a href="https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/NegativeBinomialDistribution.html">
Wolfram documentation</a>). When <tt>p == 1</tt>, this means that trial always succeeds, 
so it's obvious that the probability to get 0 failures is 1, and the probability for 
<tt>i &gt; 0</tt> failures is 0. This is exactly what the mathematical definition in
28.5.9.3.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.dist.bern.negbin">[rand.dist.bern.negbin]</a> gives with convention <tt>0<sup>0</sup> = 1</tt> 
when <tt>p == 1</tt>.
</p>

Software such as 
<a href="https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/NegativeBinomialDistribution.html">Mathematica</a>,

and <a href="http://search.r-project.org/R/library/stats/html/NegBinomial.html">R</a> all
accept <tt>p == 1</tt> for negative binomial distribution and they use the integer parameter 
as number of successes like the C++ standard.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
What comes to the reasons why <tt>p == 1</tt> could have been considered invalid, it
seems that major implementations &mdash; namely 
<a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/07c86323a199ca15177d99ad6c488b8f5fb5c729/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits/random.h#L4240">libstd++</a>,

<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/0e336ac7379c5b4d80280fa828b1a3bccc351d27/stl/inc/random#L4350">MSVC
standard library</a> &mdash; are using <tt>std::gamma_distribution</tt> in 
<tt>std::negative_binomial_distribution</tt> and passing <tt>(1 - p)/p</tt> as the second argument
of <tt>std::gamma_distribution</tt>. Case <tt>p == 1</tt> is not checked leading to violation of
precondition of <tt>std::gamma_distribution</tt>, which requires argument to be <tt>&gt; 0</tt>.
<p/>
For these reasons the note added by resolution of LWG 2406 seems invalid and could be considered for 
removal. However given the current status and history regarding handling of case <tt>p == 1</tt>, 
removing the note might not be the only option to consider.

<a href="https://wg21.link/n4849">N4849</a> 33.5.7.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.ref.ops">[atomics.ref.ops]</a>/1 
describes <tt>atomic_ref&lt;T&gt;::required_alignment</tt> constant as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The alignment required for an object to be referenced by an atomic
reference, which is at least <tt>alignof(T)</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This wording allows for an implementation to always define <tt>required_alignment</tt> 
to be equal to <tt>alignof(T)</tt> and implement atomic operations using locking, 
even if a lock-free implementation is possible at a higher alignment. For example, 
on x86-64, <tt>atomic_ref&lt;complex&lt;double&gt;&gt;</tt> could be lock-free 
only when the referred object is aligned to 16 bytes, but the above definition 
allows an implementation to define <tt>required_alignment</tt> to 8 and use locking.
<p/>
The note in 33.5.7.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.ref.ops">[atomics.ref.ops]</a>/2 does mention that lock-free operations
may require higher alignment, but it does not provide guidance to the implementations 
so that <tt>required_alignment</tt> reflects alignment required for lock-free 
operations, if possible, and not just minimum alignment required for any kind of 
implementation.
<p/>
The suggested resolution is to change the wording so that it is clear
that <tt>required_alignment</tt> indicates the alignment required for lock-free
implementation, if one is possible, or <tt>alignof(T)</tt> otherwise.
<p/>
Further, the note in 33.5.7.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.ref.ops">[atomics.ref.ops]</a>/2 contains this sentence:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Further, whether operations on an <tt>atomic_ref</tt> are lock-free could
depend on the alignment of the referenced object.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This sentence is misleading, because according to <tt>is_lock_free()</tt>
definition in 33.5.7.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.ref.ops">[atomics.ref.ops]</a>/4, the lock-free property is not 
allowed to depend on the alignment of a particular referenced object
(<tt>is_lock_free()</tt> must return <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt> if 
operations on <em>all</em> objects of the given type <tt>T</tt> are lock-free or 
not). In other words, <tt>atomic_ref</tt> can only refer to an object aligned at 
least to <tt>required_alignment</tt> and its lock-free capability cannot depend 
on the actual runtime alignment of the object.
<p/>
To avoid the confusion, I propose to remove the sentence. The rest of
the note can stay intact. However, this second edit is less important
than the first one and can be omitted in case of disagreement.

<p>
Several of the function specifications in 22.7.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/any.class">[any.class]</a> have <i>Throws:</i> elements, 
but those only mention "exceptions thrown by a constructor". It seems necessary for <tt>std::any</tt> 
to perform dynamic allocation in general, and so in general there should be a possibility of an 
exception raised by such dynamic allocation. (This may come from a user-provided 
<tt>T::operator new</tt>, as far as I can tell.)
<p/>
We should revise the specifications to add relevant sources of exceptions.
<p/>
The functions that should probably mention allocations are:
<p/>
<ul>
<li><p><tt>any(const any&amp; other)</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>template&lt;class T&gt; any(T&amp;&amp; value)</tt></p></li>

<li><p><tt>template&lt;class T&gt; any&amp; operator=(T&amp;&amp; rhs)</tt></p></li>
<li><p>all <tt>emplace</tt> overloads</p></li>
</ul>
<p/>
Proposed wording: None yet. Maybe insert something like "thrown by unspecified, internal bookkeeping logic" 
into each <i>Throws:</i> element, but perhaps something more specific is necessary.

Paper <a href="https://wg21.link/p1831r1">P1831R1</a> aimed to deprecate all 
the atomic overloads for <tt>volatile</tt> qualified member function of 
<tt>std::atomic</tt> unless <tt>is_always_lock_free</tt> is <tt>true</tt>. 
There are a few omissions in the wording.
<p/>
First, <tt>operator++</tt> and <tt>operator--</tt> are correctly constrained, 
but the deprecated overloads are not restored in Annex D, unlike the other
member functions. I confirmed with the paper author this is an accidental 
oversight, and not an intended change of behavior for C++20.
<p/>
Secondly, the wait/notify APIs were added after the initial wording
For this paper was drafted, and the paper did not catch up. Again, I 
confirmed with the paper author that these functions should be
similarly constrained and deprecated.

<p>Priority to 3 after reflector discussion. The suggested wording was generally accepted, but there
were considerable doubts that it is necessary to add deprecated functions of the new <tt>wait/notify</tt>

LEWG should express their opinion here.</p>

<p>
The suggested wording changes for 33.5.9 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.nonmembers">[atomics.nonmembers]</a> attempts to make clear that 
any of the specification elements of the member function (including but not restricted to <i>Constraints:</i>
elements) are also imposed on the corresponding non-member function template. According to 
16.3.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/structure.specifications">[structure.specifications]</a>, the wording "the semantics of the code sequence are determined 
by the <i>Constraints</i>,[&hellip;], and <i>Error conditions</i> specified for the function invocations contained in 
the code sequence." should realize the wanted effect. The advantage of this more general wording form is
that we don't need to to worry in case that in the future <i>Constraints:</i> elements of the member 
functions are modified.

It has been pointed out both on the LWG reflector and as

definition of "models" added in <a href="https://wg21.link/p2101r0">P2101R0</a>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
<tt>std::construct_at</tt> is ill-formed for array types, because the type of the <tt>new</tt>-expression is <tt>T</tt> 
not <tt>T*</tt> so it cannot be converted to the return type.
<p/>
In C++17 <tt>allocator_traits::construct</tt> did work for arrays, because it returns <tt>void</tt> so there is no 
ill-formed conversion. On the other hand, in C++17 <tt>allocator_traits::destroy</tt> didn't work for arrays, 
because <tt>p-&gt;~T()</tt> isn't valid.
<p/>
In C++20 <tt>allocator_traits::destroy</tt> does work, because <tt>std::destroy_at</tt> treats arrays specially, 
but <tt>allocator_traits::construct</tt> no longer works because it uses <tt>std::construct_at</tt>.
<p/>
It seems unnecessary and/or confusing to remove support for arrays in <tt>construct</tt> when we're adding it in <tt>destroy</tt>.
<p/>
I suggest that <tt>std::construct_at</tt> should also handle arrays. It might be reasonable to restrict that 
support to the case where <tt>sizeof...(Args) == 0</tt>, if supporting parenthesized aggregate-initialization 
is not desirable in <tt>std::construct_at</tt>.

However, the introductory sentences in 24.2.5.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.node.overview">[container.node.overview]</a> do not relate 
"compatible nodes" with Table 79 and do not clearly state transitivity:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
A node handle is an object that accepts ownership of a single element from an associative container 
(24.2.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/associative.reqmts">[associative.reqmts]</a>) or an unordered associative container (24.2.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unord.req">[unord.req]</a>). 
It may be used to transfer that ownership to another container with compatible nodes. Containers 
with compatible nodes have the same node handle type. Elements may be transferred in either direction 
between container types in the same row of Table 79 [tab:container.node.compat].

The library specification conveys pre-concept requirements on template
parameters by naming, e.g. "<tt>InputIterator</tt>".
<p/>
There is no general specification for template parameters named "<tt>Distance</tt>",
as used by <tt>std::advance</tt> (see 25.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.operations">[iterator.operations]</a>).
When addressing this omission, the local restriction in 27.7.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/alg.random.sample">[alg.random.sample]</a> 
could possibly be removed.

The effects in 19.1.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/networking-ts/socket.streambuf.members">[networking.ts::socket.streambuf.members]</a> p3 say that the function loops through every endpoint in the 
sequence, attempting to establish a connection. It needs to say that as soon as a connection is successfully established 
it returns. Otherwise even if a connection is made, it closes the socket and tries the next endpoint in the sequence. 
That means it will always be left in whatever state resulted from trying the last endpoint in the sequence (or from 
timing out if the expiry time was reached before iterating through all endpoints).

<p>
Trying to implement a <tt>constexpr std::list</tt> (inspired by Tim Song's
note on using variant members in the node) as part of evaluating
the <tt>constexpr</tt> container and adapters proposals, I hit problems
I could not code around in <tt>pointer_traits</tt>, as only the specialization
for native pointers has a <tt>constexpr pointer_to</tt> function.
<p/>
This means that containers of my custom allocator, that delegates
all allocation behavior to <tt>std::allocator&lt;T&gt;</tt> but adds extra
telemetry and uses a fancy pointer, does not work with the approach
I tried for implementing <tt>list</tt> (common link type, shared between
nodes, and stored as <tt>end</tt> sentinel directly in the <tt>list</tt> object).

<p><i>[2022-07-19; Casey Carter comments]</i></p>

<p>
 This is no longer simply a theoretical problem that impedes implementing 
 <tt>constexpr std::list</tt>, but an actual defect affecting current 
 implementations of <tt>constexpr std::string</tt>. More specifically, it 
 makes it impossible to  support so-called "fancy pointers" in a <tt>constexpr 
 basic_string</tt> that performs the small string optimization (SSO). 
 (<tt>pointer_traits::pointer_to</tt> is critically necessary to get a 
 pointer that designates the SSO buffer.) As things currently stand, 
 <tt>constexpr basic_string</tt> can support fancy pointers <em>or</em> SSO, 
 but not both.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The intention of 22.13.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/charconv.from.chars">[charconv.from.chars]</a> p7 is that the <tt>fmt</tt> argument modifies 
the expected pattern, so that only a specific subset of valid <tt>strtod</tt> patterns are recognized 
for each format. This is not clear from the wording.
<p/>
When <tt>fmt == chars_format::fixed</tt> no exponent is to be used, so any trailing characters that match 
the form of a <tt>strtod</tt> exponent are ignored. For example, <tt>"1.23e4"</tt> should produce the result 
<tt>1.23</tt> for the fixed format. The current wording says "the optional exponent part shall not appear" 
which can be interpreted to mean that <tt>"1.23e4"</tt> violates a precondition and so has undefined behaviour!
<p/>
When <tt>fmt != chars_format::hex</tt> only decimal numbers should be recognized. This means that for any
format except scientific, <tt>"0x123"</tt> produces <tt>0.0</tt> (it's invalid when 
<tt>fmt == chars_format::scientific</tt> because there's no exponent). The current wording only says that 
when <tt>hex</tt> is used the string has an assumed <tt>"0x"</tt> prefix, so is interpreted as a hexadecimal 
float, it doesn't say that when <tt>fmt != hex</tt> that the string is <em>not</em> interpreted as a 
hexadecimal float.
<p/>
Two alternative resolutions are provided, one is a minimal fix and the other attempts to make it clearer by 
not referring to a modified version of the C rules.

This requires the implicit and explicit conversions to produce equal results.
<p/>
However, it seems that when <tt>To</tt> is a reference-to-function type, this restriction does not apply. 
This makes it possible to create a class that models <tt>convertible_to</tt>, but produces different 
results depending on the kind of conversion:
</p>

#include &lt;concepts&gt;

int foo() { return 0; }

static_assert(std::convertible_to&lt;A, FT&amp;&gt;);

<p>
The requirements for the overloads of <tt>std::transform_inclusive_scan</tt>
without an initial value incorrectly assume that the internal accumulator uses 
the iterator's value type, as it does for <tt>std::inclusive_scan</tt>, rather 
than the transformed type of the iterator's value type, as it was intended.
<p/>
According to the standard, the following program is ill-formed as it
requires <tt>std::string</tt> to be convertible to <tt>int</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
auto vs = {0, 1, 2};
std::transform_inclusive_scan(
   vs.begin(), vs.end(),
   std::ostream_iterator&lt;std::string&gt;(std::cout, ";"),
   [](std::string x, std::string y) { return x + y; },
   [](int x) { return std::to_string(x); });

libstdc++ and Microsoft's STL accept the snippet, producing <tt>0;01;012;</tt>
as expected, libc++ strictly conforms to the standard and rejects it.

<p>
<tt>(j)thread</tt>'s constructor needs to <tt><i>decay-copy</i></tt> the supplied parameters and callable over to the started 
thread through an operating system API that generally only accepts a single <tt>void*</tt>. The MSVC++ and libc++ 
implementations do this by putting the parameters in a <tt>std::tuple</tt> allocated from the heap, passing a 
pointer to that tuple through the operating system API, and leaving ownership of the parameters to the other thread.
<p/>
It might be theoretically possible to introduce an additional copy and synchronization where the starting thread 
blocks for the started thread to make a move constructed copy of that tuple from the parameters, but that would 
introduce unreasonable synchronization overhead since the starting thread would have to block for all TLS 
initializers and similar in the started thread.
<p/>
It is technically possible to implement the current design by transforming this allocation failure into 
<tt>resource_unavailable_try_again</tt>, but the description for this error in the standard is that some thread-based 
limitation has been reached, not a general memory limit, so that doesn't seem to meet the spirit of the requirement.
</p>
<p><i>[2020-08-21; Issue processing telecon: set priority to 3]</i></p>

<p>
Jonathan: I prefer Option A, but I think we need something like:
"any exceptions thrown by the <i><tt>decay-copy</tt></i> calls, or ...".

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
From this <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/4144">editorial issue request</a>: 
<p/>
The header <tt>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</tt> is currently specified in 17.14.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/support.c.headers.other">[support.c.headers.other]</a> 
to not declare a global name corresponding to <tt>std::byte</tt>, but no similar exclusion exists for 
<tt>std::nullptr_t</tt>.
<p/>
Is an oversight or intentional? There does not seem to be an interoperability reason to provide a global 
namespace name <tt>::nullptr_t</tt>, since this construction would be meaningless in C and thus the name 
would not be encountered in code that is both valid C and C++.
<p/>
For lack of justification, I would like to propose to require normatively that no name 
<tt>::nullptr_t</tt> be declared by <tt>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
Additional notes: The proposing paper <a href="https://wg21.link/n2431">N2431</a> mentions only an addition 
of "<tt>nullptr_t</tt>" to <tt>&lt;cstddef&gt;</tt> and does not discuss the impact on <tt>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</tt>. 
By omission this means the default rules for <tt>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</tt> apply and the global name should exist, 
but this does not provide us with a positive signal of intention.
<p/>
I also realize that this is a rather obscure point, and that vendors are already shipping <tt>::nullptr_t</tt>, 
so I am also happy to drop this issue as not being worth the churn and the increase in implementation complexity 
(since removals don't generally simplify implementations). I would welcome a bit of discussion, though.

<p>
Consider the following program:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;atomic&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;thread&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int i{500};
  atomic_ref atom{i};
  i += 500;
  thread t1{[&amp;atom] { for (int val{0}, x{0}; x &lt; 70;) {
    if (atom.compare_exchange_weak(val, val + 10)) { ++x; }}}};
  thread t2{[&amp;atom] { for (int val{0}, y{0}; y &lt; 29;) {
    if (atom.compare_exchange_weak(val, val + 1)) { ++y; }}}};
  t1.join(); t2.join();
  cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl; // 1729
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Technically this program has undefined behavior. 33.5.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.ref.generic">[atomics.ref.generic]</a> p3 says 
that, during the lifetime of any <tt>atomic_ref</tt> referring to an object, that the object 
may only be accessed through the <tt>atomic_ref</tt> instances. However, in this example the 
<tt>atomic_ref</tt> is constructed before the <tt>i+=500</tt> and is not destroyed before the 
print, even though we have a happens-before relationship between the atomic and non-atomic 
'phases' of access of the value.
<p/>
The user would instead have to write:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;atomic&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;thread&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int i{500};
  i += 500;
  {
    atomic_ref atom{i};
    thread t1{[&amp;atom] { for (int val{0}, x{0}; x &lt; 70;) {
      if (atom.compare_exchange_weak(val, val + 10)) { ++x; }}}};
    thread t2{[&amp;atom] { for (int val{0}, y{0}; y &lt; 29;) {
      if (atom.compare_exchange_weak(val, val + 1)) { ++y; }}}};
    t1.join(); t2.join();
  } // destroy atom
  cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl; // 1729
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
We should probably get SG1 on record clarifying whether they intend the first program to be acceptable. 
I can think of a reason to for <tt>atomic_ref</tt>'s ctor to do something (zeroing out padding), but 
in our implementation it does nothing. I can't think of any reason for <tt>atomic_ref</tt>'s dtor to 
do anything.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
According to the current wording,
<tt>std::is_constructible&lt;int[], int&gt;</tt>
should be true, because the preconditions are met
(all types are complete types or unbounded arrays)
and the variable definition is well-formed since C++20:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
using T = int[];
T t(declval&lt;int&gt;()); <i>// equiv. to</i> int t[] = {1};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
However, this doesn't construct an object of type <tt>int[]</tt>
because it deduces the array bound from the initializers,
and so constructs <tt>int[1]</tt>, which is not the type being asked about.
It seems more logical for the trait to give a false result
for an unbounded array, because it's an incomplete type,
and no <tt>int[]</tt> can ever be constructed.
</p>

<p>
On the reflector Tim Song noted:
</p>
<blockquote>
On the other hand, the result is something to which an <tt>int(&amp;)[]</tt>
can be bound directly thanks to another C++20 change,
so a lot of things might Just Work (for some definition of "Work")
despite the type difference.
</blockquote>

<p>
This seems to me a reasonable rationale for
<tt>is_constructible&lt;int(&amp;&amp;)[], int&gt;</tt>
to be true (which it is today),
but not for <tt>int[]</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Peter Dimov replied:
</p>
<blockquote>
Placement new, which is often the way to construct we're interested in,
is not going to work even for <tt>T[2]</tt>.
</blockquote>

<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
using T2 = int[2];
T2 x;
new(x) T2(1, 2); <i>// ill-formed</i>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
We need to decide what behaviour we want here.
Do we just want <tt>is_constructible</tt>
to reflect the <tt>T(declval&lt;Args...&gt;);</tt> construct
as currently specified in 21.3.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/meta.unary.prop">[meta.unary.prop]</a> p8,
or do we want to give a more useful/meaningful answer here?
</p>

<p>
Should we revisit 21.3.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/meta.unary.prop">[meta.unary.prop]</a> p8
in the light of parenthesized aggregate init,
so that <tt>is_constructible&lt;T[], T&gt;</tt>
and <tt>is_constructible&lt;T[1], T&gt;</tt> are false?
</p>

<p>
There may be some interaction with LWG <a href="3436">3436</a>.

<p>
Per 24.3.7.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/array.special">[array.special]</a>/1,
<tt>std::array</tt>'s non-member swap participates in overload resolution
when the array has size 0 or swappable elements.
The effects of non-member swap are "As if by [member swap]",
but member swap's effects are simply
"Equivalent to swap_ranges(begin(), end(), y.begin())"
per 24.3.7.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/array.members">[array.members]</a>/4.
In effect, we've gone out of our way to ensure that
<tt>is_swappable_v&lt;array&lt;T, 0&gt;&gt;</tt>
and <tt>swappable&lt;array&lt;T, 0&gt;&gt;</tt>
are always true
despite that actually swapping such an array may be ill-formed.
</p>

<p>
It seems that the wording stops half-way to making
<tt>array&lt;T, 0&gt;</tt> swappable regardless of <tt>T</tt>.
I personally find that design distasteful
- it seems a gratuitous difference between
<tt>array&lt;T, N&gt;</tt> and <tt>array&lt;T, 0&gt;</tt>
- but I'd prefer a consistent design over the status quo
even if it's the "wrong" design.

<p>
While implementing <tt>iranges::stream_view</tt> we found some issues with the <i>Preconditions</i> 
on the member functions of <tt>istream_view::iterator</tt>, which are superfluous or incorrect.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
26.6.6.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.istream.iterator">[range.istream.iterator]</a> p2 reads as:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Preconditions:</i> <tt><i>parent_</i>-&gt;<i>stream_</i> != nullptr</tt> is <tt>true</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
However in the <i>Effects</i> element 26.6.6.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.istream.iterator">[range.istream.iterator]</a> p3 it reads:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects:</i> Equivalent to:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
*<i>parent_</i>-&gt;<i>stream_</i> &gt;&gt; <i>parent_</i>-&gt;<i>object_</i>;
return *this;
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
For the <i>Effects</i> element to be valid, we implicitly require that <tt><i>parent_</i> != nullptr</tt>, 
<tt><i>parent_</i>-&gt;<i>stream_</i> != nullptr</tt> and &mdash; because we are reading from the underlying 
stream &mdash; <tt>!*x.<i>parent_</i>-&gt;<i>stream_</i></tt>.
<p/>
Given that the <i>Preconditions</i> element only mentions one of the three preconditions and essentially 
means that we are not at the end of the stream, we should replace 26.6.6.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.istream.iterator">[range.istream.iterator]</a> p2 
by:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Preconditions:</i> <tt>*this != default_sentinel</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>
We should use the same precondition for 26.6.6.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.istream.iterator">[range.istream.iterator]</a> p4, even if it is implicit 
via the <i>Effects</i> element in 26.6.6.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.istream.iterator">[range.istream.iterator]</a> p5, as that requires experts knowledge 
of the standard.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The Precondition in 26.6.6.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.istream.iterator">[range.istream.iterator]</a> p6 is completely bogus, as accessing the 
cached object has no dependency on the stream. We assume it is meant that we are not at the end of the stream. 
Again we should change this to:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Preconditions:</i> <tt>*this != default_sentinel</tt>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>[2020-10-14; Priority to P3 after reflector discusssion]</i></p>


<p><i>[2021-09-02; Jonathan comments:]</i></p>

<p>
The preconditions were removed by <a href="https://wg21.link/P2325R3">P2325R3</a> approved in June 2021.
Although the pointers now cannot be null, it's unclear if we want to require
<code>fail()</code> to be false for the stream.

<p>
Some of our newer wording for C++20 uses the term "decayed type" as if it were 
a defined term of art.  While I have intuition for what may be intended in these 
cases, it turns out the "function to function pointer decay" and "array to array 
pointer decay" were never actually Core terms of art &mdash; having searched all
standards going back as far as C++03.
<p/>
We should either define this term for library use, or find a way to state
our intent using existing well-defined terms of art.

<p>
In <a href="https://wg21.link/p0288">P0288</a>, <tt>any_invocable</tt> is (correctly) constraining
its constructor that takes an <tt>F</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class F&gt; any_invocable(F&amp;&amp; f);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
Let <tt>VT</tt> be <tt>decay_t&lt;F&gt;</tt>.

<li><p>&mdash; [&hellip;]</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
<tt>std::function</tt> doesn't do that. According to <a href="https://wg21.link/n4868">N4868</a>,
22.10.17.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/func.wrap.func.con">[func.wrap.func.con]</a> p8 has a constraint for Lvalue-Callable, but not for
copy-constructibility. There is a precondition in p9, but that's not enough for portable
well/ill-formedness.
<p/>
Since this is a constructor, and we want to give the right answer to
<tt>is_constructible</tt>/<tt>constructible_from</tt> queries, we should
add the relevant constraint.
</p>

<p><i>[2020-11-01; Daniel comments]</i></p>

<p>
This issue has some overlap with LWG <a href="2774">2774</a>.

<p><i>[2021-01-15; Telecon prioritization]</i></p>

<p>

</p>

<p><i>[2021-05-17; Tim comments]</i></p>

<p>
The new constraint causes constraint recursion in an example like:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
struct C {
    explicit C(std::function&lt;void()&gt;); // #1
    void operator()() {}
};
static_assert(std::is_constructible_v&lt;C, const C&amp;&gt;);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here, to determine whether a <tt>C</tt> can be constructed from a <tt>const C</tt>
lvalue, the overload resolution will attempt to determine whether the constructor
marked <tt>#1</tt> is a viable candidate, which involves a determination of
whether that lvalue can be implicitly converted to a <tt>std::function&lt;void()&gt;</tt>,
which, with the new constraint, requires a determination whether
<tt>C</tt> is copy-constructible &mdash; in other words, whether it can be constructed
from a <tt>C</tt> lvalue.
<p/>
This is similar to LWG <a href="3420">3420</a>: in both cases we have a class
(<tt>filesystem::path</tt> there, <tt>function</tt> here) that is
convertible from every type that are, <i>inter alia</i>, copy constructible,
and this then results in constraint recursion when we ask whether a different
type that is constructible from such a class is copy constructible.
<p/>
The <tt>C</tt> above is reduced from an internal helper type in libstdc++. Given
the ubiquity of call wrappers &mdash; types that are callable in their own right
and therefore may not be able to be ruled out by the Lvalue-Callable constraint,
and can also naturally have a constructor that take the wrapped function object
as the argument, triggering the recursion scenario &mdash; it is not clear that
there is a good way to add this constraint without causing undue breakage.
</p>

<p><i>[2021-08-20; LWG telecon]</i></p>

<p>
LWG requested that the constraint cited above for
<code>move_only_function</code> (n&eacute; <code>any_invocable</code>)
be moved to a <i>Mandates:</i> element instead, to avoid the same
constraint recursion.

31.11.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/syncstream.syncbuf.members">[syncstream.syncbuf.members]</a> p5 says "May call member functions of <tt>wrapped</tt> while holding a 
lock uniquely associated with <tt>wrapped</tt>."
<p/>
It's unclear what "uniquely associated" means. Is it required to be a one-to-one mapping, so that every 
<tt>streambuf*</tt> that is wrapped is associated with a different lock?
<p/>
I believe the intention is only that for a given <tt>streambuf*</tt> every <tt>syncbuf</tt> that wraps it 
uses the same lock. The intention was that it's a valid implementation for the same lock to be used for more 
than one <tt>streambuf*</tt> (e.g. using a table of <tt>N</tt> locks which are indexed by a hash of the 
<tt>streambuf* value)</tt>. The current wording can be interpreted to forbid that implementation.

The timed lockable and mutex requirements currently use "<tt>rel_time</tt> denotes an object of an

to define the variables used to specify the timed lock functions. During LWG review of

<p>
From <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/pull/4300">this editorial issue request</a>: 
</p>
<p>
The three <tt>basic_syncbuf</tt>-related manipulators <tt>emit_on_flush</tt>, <tt>noemit_on_flush</tt>, 
and <tt>flush_emit</tt> use in their <i>Effects:</i> elements the following wording:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"If <tt>os.rdbuf()</tt> is a <tt>basic_syncbuf&lt;charT, traits, Allocator&gt;*</tt>, called <tt>buf</tt> 
for the purpose of exposition, calls [&hellip;]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
There are two problems with that wording (even when considering the helpful note following p8): First, 
the type <tt>Allocator</tt> is not defined elsewhere (e.g. it is not part of the function signature) 
and second, <tt>os.rdbuf()</tt> has type <tt>basic_streambuf&lt;charT, traits&gt;*</tt> and not any 
other type.
<p/>
By introducing an expository <tt><i>SYNCBUF</i></tt> to detect <tt>basic_syncbuf</tt> during the work 
on the above mentioned editorial issue to solve these problems it turned out that the suggested wording 
fix would introduce an apparently normative change that the <tt>syncbuf</tt> type must not use a 
program-defined specialization.

<p>
29.5.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.duration.cast">[time.duration.cast]</a> p7 requires that the return value is "The least result <tt>t</tt> 
representable in <tt>ToDuration</tt> for which <tt>t &gt;= d</tt>".
<p/>
This means that <tt>chrono::ceil&lt;chrono::microseconds&gt;(chrono::duration&lt;float, milli&gt;(m)).count()</tt> 
is required to be the smallest integer <tt>n</tt> such that <tt>(float)n == m*1000.0f</tt>, which might be less 
than the mathematically correct value of <tt>m x 1000</tt>.
<p/>
(The specific values below assume <tt>float</tt> uses the IEEE binary32 format and default rounding, but 
similar problems will exist for other formats, even if the specific values are different.)
<p/>
For example, if <tt>m == 13421772.0f</tt> then the naively expected result is <tt>n == 13421772000</tt>, but 
the standard requires <tt>n == 13421771265</tt>, a significantly lower value. This surprising result is a 
consequence of how the <tt>chrono::ceil</tt> spec interacts with floating-point arithmetic, due to the fact that 
for the integers in the range <tt>[13421770753, 13421772799]</tt>, only one can be exactly represented as 
32-bit <tt>float</tt>. All but that one will be rounded to a different value when converted to <tt>float</tt>.
<p/>
A straightforward implementation of <tt>chrono::ceil</tt> will produce <tt>(long long)(13421772.0f * 1000)</tt> 
which is <tt>13421771776</tt>, which is less than the expected result, but compares equal using the <tt>t &gt;= d</tt> 
expression. That expression converts both operands to their <tt>common_type</tt>, which is 
<tt>chrono::duration&lt;float, micro&gt;</tt>. That means we compare <tt>(float)13421771776 &gt;= (13421772.0f * 1000)</tt> 
which is <tt>true</tt>. But the spec requires an even worse result. All integers in <tt>[13421771265, 13421771776)</tt> 
are also rounded to that value when converted to <tt>float</tt>. That means <tt>chrono::microseconds(13421771265)</tt> 
is "the least result representable in <tt>ToDuration</tt> for which <tt>t &gt;= d</tt>".
<p/>
Meeting the "least result" requirement is impractical, and unhelpful. The straightforward result <tt>13421771776</tt> 
is already lower than the naively expected result (which is surprising for a "ceil" function). To meet the 
standard's requirements the implementation would have to do extra work, just to produce an even lower (and even 
more surprising) result.
<p/>
It might be impractical to require the naively expected value to be returned (the additional work might have 
unacceptable performance implications), but the standard  should at least permit the straightforward result 
instead of requiring an even worse one.
<p/>
The same problem almost certainly exists for <tt>chrono::floor</tt> in reverse.

33.7.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.condition.condvar">[thread.condition.condvar]</a> p24 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Effects:</i> Equivalent to: <tt>return wait_until(lock, chrono::steady_clock::now() + rel_time);</tt>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is overspecification, removing implementer freedom to make <tt>cv.wait_for(duration&lt;float&gt;(1))</tt> work accurately.
<p/>
The type of <tt>steady_clock::now() + duration&lt;float&gt;(n)</tt> is <tt>time_point&lt;steady_clock, 
duration&lt;float, steady_clock::period&gt;&gt;</tt>. If the steady clock's period is <tt>std::nano</tt> 
and its epoch is the time the system booted, then in under a second a 32-bit <tt>float</tt> becomes unable 
to exactly represent those <tt>time_points</tt>! Every second after boot makes <tt>duration&lt;float, nano&gt;</tt> 
less precise.
<p/>
This means that adding a <tt>duration&lt;float&gt;</tt> to a <tt>time_point</tt> (or <tt>duration</tt>) 
measured in nanoseconds is unlikely to produce an accurate value. Either it will round down to a value less 
than <tt>now()</tt>, or round up to one greater than <tt>now() + 1s</tt>. Either way, the <tt>wait_for(rel_time)</tt> 
doesn't wait for the specified time, and users think the implementation is faulty.
<p/>
A possible solution is to use <tt>steady_clock::now() + ceil&lt;steady_clock::duration&gt;(rel_time)</tt> 
instead. This converts the relative time to a suitably large integer, and then the addition is not affected 
by floating-point rounding errors due to the limited precision of 32-bit <tt>float</tt>. Libstdc++ has been 
doing this for nearly three years. Alternatively, the standard could just say that the relative timeout is 
converted to an absolute timeout measured against the steady clock, and leave the details to the implementation. 
Some implementations might not be affected by the problem (e.g. if the steady clock measures milliseconds, 
or processes only run for a few seconds and use the process start as the steady clock's epoch).
<p/>
This also affects the other overload of <tt>condition_variable::wait_for</tt>, and both overloads of 
<tt>condition_variable_any::wait_for</tt>.

<p>
The specification of 19.6.3.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/stacktrace.entry.query">[stacktrace.entry.query]</a> uses the terms "presumed or actual name 
of the source file" and "actual line number". It makes reference to 15.11 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/cpp.predefined">[cpp.predefined]</a>, 
which introduces the term "presumed". It does not clearly define the term, but it describes how the 
presumed values can be modified with preprocessor directives. However, there is no definition whatsoever 
of "actual".
<p/>
The term should either be defined, or we should strike the "actual" parts of the stacktrace wording. 
We should consult implementers about this.
<p/>
I don't have a proposed resolution, but if we want to keep "actual", then perhaps we should define 
both "presumed" and "actual" in 15.11 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/cpp.predefined">[cpp.predefined]</a>.

We want to know the original intended meaning of "actual line number" here.
Presumably debuginfo stored in binaries uses a real line number in the source,

The "presumed or actual" wording was added in R2 of the paper, possibly
as a result of LWG review.

<tt>atomic_ref&lt;T&gt;</tt> requires only that its template parameter <tt>T</tt> is trivially copyable,
which is not sufficient to implement many of the class template's member functions. Consider, for example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
int main() {
  static const int x = 42;
  std::atomic_ref&lt;const int&gt; meow{x};
  meow.store(0);
  return meow.load();
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Since <tt>const int</tt> is trivially copyable, this is a well-formed C++20 program that returns <tt>0</tt>.
That said, the <tt>store</tt> call that mutates the value of a constant object is (a) not implementable with
library technology, and (b) pure madness that violates the language semantics. <tt>atomic_ref::store</tt>
should presumably require <tt>is_copy_assignable_v&lt;T&gt;</tt>, and other operations need to have their
requirements audited as well. (Related: LWG <a href="3012">3012</a> made similar changes to <tt>atomic</tt>.)
<p/>
As a related issue, <tt>volatile atomic&lt;T&gt;</tt> recently had its member functions deprecated when they
are not lock-free. Presumably <tt>atomic_ref&lt;volatile T&gt;</tt> should require that atomic operations on
<tt>T</tt> be lock-free for consistency.
<p/>

The last point is related to LWG <a href="3417">3417</a> (another case where we screwed up the <tt>volatile</tt>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The intent of LWG <a href="1204">1204</a> is to allow standard library APIs accepting rvalue arguments:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to move from their arguments, e.g., without having to specify that they might do this as part of 
their <i>Effects</i> clause, and</p></li>
<li><p>to assume that rvalue arguments do not alias any pointer in the scope of the standard library API, 
e.g., to allow <tt>vector</tt>'s <tt>push_back(T&amp;&amp; t)</tt> to assume that <tt>t</tt> is not an 
element of the <tt>vector</tt>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
The current wording in 16.4.5.9 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/res.on.arguments">[res.on.arguments]</a>/1.3 states:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
If a function argument binds to an rvalue reference parameter, the implementation may assume that this 
parameter is a unique reference to this argument.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This sentence is not clear about the scope in which the reference can be assumed to be unique, and it 
does not explicitly state that the function can modify the argument, e.g., to move from it.
<p/>
If the scope of the "unique reference" is "whole program scope", this example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void example(vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; a, int* b) 
{
  int* c = b;            <i>// reference to object pointed at by</i> <tt>b</tt>
  a.push_back(move(*b)); <i>// UB: rvalue reference aliases</i> <tt>c</tt><i>: not unique in whole-program scope</i>
  assert(c == b);        <i>// FAILS: if rvalue reference to</i> <tt>*b</tt><i> is unique,</i> <tt>b</tt><i> is unique, and</i> <tt>c == b</tt><i> is false</i>
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
exhibits UB because the implementation may assume that the reference to <tt>b</tt> is unique, which 
does not hold since <tt>c</tt> is also a reference to <tt>b</tt>.  
<p/>
If the scope of the "unique reference" is the "function scope" of the standard
library API, then the semantics of the rvalue reference argument are very similar
to those of C's <tt>restrict</tt>. This allows aliasing optimizations, for example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void std_api(int&amp;&amp; a, int&amp;&amp; b); <i>// allowed to assume that</i> <tt>a</tt><i> and</i> <tt>b</tt> <i>do not alias</i>
int a, b, c;
std_api(move(a), move(b)); <i>// OK: two unique references in</i> <tt>std_api</tt>
std_api(move(c), move(c)); <i>// UB:</i> <tt>a</tt> <i>and</i> <tt>b</tt> <i>alias</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
See <a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48238">llvm Bug 48238</a> for a bug tracking 
the implementation of these optimizations in clang.
<p/>
This also allows optimizing <tt>vector::push_back(T&amp;&amp; t)</tt> since if <tt>t</tt> does not 
alias any pointer in <tt>vector::push_back</tt>'s scope, it also does not alias <tt>this</tt>, 
<tt>this-&gt;data()</tt>, <tt>(*this)[0]</tt>, etc.

<p>
A program-defined type is either a type or an instantiation. "program-defined type" is used in

template.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
ISO requires that the terms in Clause 3 be substitutable with their definitions. If this were done for 
"program-defined type", we'd end up with "or an instantiation of a program-defined specialization".
It's fine to depend on a type, but not an instantiated type, because all you need is the name of its 
specialization (its type) as a template argument to explicitly or partially specialize a template.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The <tt>std::mergeable</tt> concept requires elements of both source ranges to be copyable to the output iterator, while 
the standard specifically tells that both algorithms <tt>ranges::set_intersection</tt> and <tt>ranges::set_difference</tt> 
only use the first range as the source of elements to be copied into output. The following code snippet illustrates the problem:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;ranges&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;cassert&gt;
 
int main()
{
  std::vector&lt;std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;&gt; v1;
  std::vector&lt;int&gt; v2;
  
  assert(std::ranges::is_sorted(v1));
  assert(std::ranges::is_sorted(v2));
  
  std::vector&lt;std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;&gt; v3;
  
  // Compilation error on the following line:
  std::ranges::set_intersection(v1, v2, std::back_inserter(v3),
    std::less{}, [](const auto&amp; p) { return p.first; });
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The proposed solution is to introduce a new concept. It could be declared "exposition-only" and is worded 
<tt><i>half-mergeable</i></tt> below:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class I1, class I2, class Out, class R = ranges::less,
	     class P1 = identity, class P2 = identity&gt;
  concept <i>half-mergeable</i> =
    input_iterator&lt;I1&gt; &amp;&amp;
    input_iterator&lt;I2&gt; &amp;&amp;
    weakly_incrementable&lt;Out&gt; &amp;&amp;
    indirectly_copyable&lt;I1, Out&gt; &amp;&amp;
    <i>// indirectly_copyable&lt;I2, Out&gt; &amp;&amp; &lt;&mdash; this line removed</i>
    indirect_strict_weak_order&lt;R, projected&lt;I1, P1&gt;, projected&lt;I2, P2&gt;&gt;;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
After such template is introduced, <tt>std::mergeable</tt> may be defined based on it:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class I1, class I2, class Out, class R = ranges::less,
	     class P1 = identity, class P2 = identity&gt;
  concept mergeable = <i>half-mergeable</i>&lt;I1, I2, Out, R, P1, P2&gt; &amp;&amp; 
    indirectly_copyable&lt;I2, Out&gt;;

Overloads for <tt>std::rbegin</tt>/<tt>rend</tt> for built-in arrays and <tt>std::initializer_list</tt>'s has

addressed a similar issue for <tt>std::begin/end</tt>.
<p/>
Suggestion: change these declarations in 25.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.range">[iterator.range]</a> (p10, 11, 12, 13) as indicated:
</p>

<p>
If this change is accepted, we may also specify <em>conditional</em> <tt>noexcept</tt> for <tt>std::crbegin/crend</tt> 
(in 25.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.range">[iterator.range]</a> p14, 15), by adding <tt>noexcept(noexcept(std::rbegin/crend(c)))</tt>, like in 
LWG <a href="2280">2280</a>.
<p/>
Conditional noexcept for other functions in 25.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.range">[iterator.range]</a> (p2, 3, 7, 8, 16, 18, 20 22) may also be 
added for consistency.

<p>
There is intentionally no P/R provided at this point, but I'm volunteering to provide it if we got feedback whether
adding <em>conditional</em> <tt>noexcept</tt> specifiers similar to those provided by LWG <a href="2280">2280</a> would
be preferred or not.

Jonathan: This would create a strange situation where <tt>std::rbegin</tt>
and <tt>std::crbegin</tt> on an <tt>initializer_list</tt> are noexcept but
<tt>std::begin</tt> and <tt>std::cbegin</tt> aren't guaranteed to be
(because an <tt>initializer_list</tt> uses the generic <tt>std::begin</tt>
and <tt>std::cbegin</tt> overloads, which have no conditional noexcept).
</p>
<p>
Casey: I don't think we should mark these rbegin/rend overloads noexcept
without making the pertinent <tt>reverse_iterator</tt> constructors
conditionally noexcept.

<a href="https://wg21.link/p0551r3">P0551R3</a> has made almost all standard library functions non-addressable, 
including all functions from the C standard library. However, C17 (and the latest C23 working draft) explicitly 
allows taking address of a C standard library function in 7.1.4/1.
<p/>
Should we require something like "every function from the C standard library is addressable unless it is overloaded", 
in order to minimize the incompatibility with C? Or explicitly say something in C.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/diff.library">[diff.library]</a> if

The C standard has a section called "Future library directions". This is subclause 7.31 in C17, which is the 
version that the C++ working draft references. C reserves the names described in that subclause for its standard 
library, allowing C library vendors to introduce some names from future standards as conforming, "orthogonal" 
extensions. ISO C++ does not appear to reserve these names in a clear way. In particular, 16.4.5.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/reserved.names">[reserved.names]</a> 
has wording about names and function signatures "from the C standard library declared with external linkage", 
but C's "Future library directions" describes names that "may be added to the declarations in [some] header[s]".
<p/>
Extra clarity regarding whether these names are actually intended to be reserved by C++ would be appreciated.

16.3.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/structure.requirements">[structure.requirements]</a> p9 says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A declaration may explicitly impose requirements through its associated
constraints (13.5.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/temp.constr.decl">[temp.constr.decl]</a>). When the associated constraints
refer to a concept (13.7.9 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/temp.concept">[temp.concept]</a>), the semantic constraints
specified for that concept are additionally imposed on the use of the declaration.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are at least two issues with this wording:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
First, "associated constraints" is a Core term that refers to the constraints
on a declaration <i>after normalization</i>, at which point direct uses of
concepts have been decomposed into the constituent atomic constraints and are
no longer visible.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Second, "refers to" is too vague. Does <tt>!C&lt;T&gt;</tt> "refer to"
<tt>C</tt> and impose its semantic constraints? Does <tt>C1&lt;T&gt; || C2&lt;T&gt;</tt>
"refer to" both <tt>C1</tt> and <tt>C2</tt> and therefore impose the semantic
constraints of both?

<p>
For the expression <tt>a.merge(a2)</tt>, it is not explicitly stated whether <tt>a2</tt> can be the 
same object as <tt>a</tt>. libstdc++-v3 and libc++ seemingly assume this is not allowed, as the following code
produces an infinite loop with both standard library implementations:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;set&gt;

int main()
{
  std::multiset&lt;int&gt; c={0, 0};
  c.merge(c);
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
A strict reading of postconditions seems to ban the case where <tt>a</tt> and <tt>a2</tt> are the same:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>24.2.7.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/associative.reqmts.general">[associative.reqmts.general]</a>: "Iterators referring to the transferred elements [&hellip;] 
now behave as iterators into <tt>a</tt>, not into <tt>a2</tt>": if <tt>a</tt> and <tt>a2</tt> are the same, 
a transferred iterator can't be both an iterator to <tt>a</tt> and not an iterator to <tt>a2</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>24.2.8.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unord.req.general">[unord.req.general]</a>: "Iterators referring to the transferred elements and all iterators 
referring to <tt>a</tt> will be invalidated, but iterators to elements remaining in <tt>a2</tt> will remain valid": 
if <tt>a</tt> and <tt>a2</tt> are the same, an iterator can't both be invalidated and remain valid.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Even if a provision is made that, when <tt>a</tt> and <tt>a2</tt> are the same, no elements are transferred by 
convention, 24.2.8.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unord.req.general">[unord.req.general]</a> would still implicitly ban the case, as all iterators would be 
invalidated but the iterators to the remaining elements (again, all iterators) would remain valid, which is 
contradictory.
<p/>
For context, analogous operations for <tt>std::list</tt> take inconsistent approaches:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><tt>splice(const_iterator position, list&amp; x)</tt> requires that source and destination be not the same.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>splice(const_iterator position, list&amp; x, const_iterator i)</tt> implicitly allows <tt>addressof(x) == this</tt>, 
as the case <tt>position == i</tt> is taken care of.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>std::list::merge</tt> explicitly allows the case <tt>addressof(x) == this</tt> (resulting in a no-op).</p></li>

<p>
For the expression <tt>a.merge(a2)</tt>, postconditions say that "iterators referring to the transferred elements 
[&hellip;] now behave as iterators into <tt>a</tt> [&hellip;]". When <tt>a</tt> and <tt>a2</tt> are of different 
types, this seems to imply, under the widest interpretation for "behaving as", that <tt>a</tt>-iterators and 
<tt>a2</tt>-iterators are actually of the same type, that is, that associative containers have SCARY iterators,
 which is, to the best of my knowledge, not currently mandated by the standard.
<p/>
There are (at least) three possible resolutions to this ambiguity, ordered by intrusiveness:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Indicate that "behaving as" only applies to the case where <tt>a</tt> and <tt>a2</tt> are of the same type.</p></li>
<li><p>Clarify what "behaving as" means. A non-SCARY interpretation is that an <tt>a2</tt>-iterator to a transferred 
element can still be dereferenced, incremented (if not past the last element of <tt>a</tt>) and decremented (if 
not pointing to the first element of <tt>a</tt>), while comparison with <tt>a</tt>-iterators and use in the 
interface of <tt>a</tt> is not guaranteed.</p></li>
<li><p>Mandate SCARY iterators by, for instance, requiring that associative containers with compatible nodes 
(24.2.5.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.node.overview">[container.node.overview]</a>/1) have the same iterator types.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that this issue does not extend to unordered associative containers, as there (24.2.8.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unord.req.general">[unord.req.general]</a>) 
iterators to transferred elements are invalidated, which makes the point of SCARYness irrelevant. That said, 
if SCARY iterators are finally required for associative containers, it makes much sense to extend the requirement 
to unordered associative containers as well.

33.10.9 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/futures.async">[futures.async]</a> (3.1) says:

<p>
It's not clear whether this includes the evaluation of the <tt><i>decay-copy</i></tt> calls in the calling 
thread, or only the invocation of invoke with the results of those <tt><i>decay-copy</i></tt> calls.
<p/>
A literal reading suggests that any exceptions from any part of that expression should be stored in the 
shared state. All of libstdc++, libc++ and MSVC only store exceptions from the call to <tt>invoke</tt>, not the 
calls to <tt><i>decay-copy</i></tt>. Exceptions from the <tt><i>decay-copy</i></tt> calls are propagated 
to the caller of <tt>std::async</tt>. We should clarify that that's what the standard means.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
We do not specify whether or not short-circuiting is expected to happen for individual conditions stated in a <i>Constraints:</i> 
element. For example, 22.4.4.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/tuple.cnstr">[tuple.cnstr]</a> p12 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Constraints:</i> <tt>sizeof...(Types)</tt> equals <tt>sizeof...(UTypes)</tt> and <tt>sizeof...(Types) &le; 1</tt> and 
<tt>is_constructible_v&lt;T<sub><i>i</i></sub> , U<sub><i>i</i></sub>&gt;</tt> is <tt>true</tt> for all <tt><i>i</i></tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
It's not even possible to test the <tt>is_constructible</tt> part unless the first part is true, so presumably it is 
expected that the <tt>sizeof...</tt> expressions are tested first, and so the <tt>is_constructible</tt> traits don't 
even need to be instantiated.
<p/>
In some cases it might be user observable whether short circuiting happens, as whether later conditions are tested might 
affect whether errors outside the immediate context are permitted or not.
<p/>
We should clarify what is intended, and refactor any <i>Constraints:</i> elements that are special cases where something 
different is required.

</p></blockquote>
<p>
A naive reader like me might interpret this as meaning that (1) you
attempt to convert the template arguments to comparison categories and
then (2) obtain the strongest among them.
<p/>
However, the intent is in fact to realize the common comparison type
notion from 11.10.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/class.spaceship">[class.spaceship]</a>/4. To obtain a non-<tt>void</tt>
result, all the template arguments must be comparison categories, rather than
convertible to comparison categories.
<p/>
17.11.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/cmp.common">[cmp.common]</a>/2 mildly contradicts the first paragraph:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;"><p>
<i>Remarks:</i> The member <i>typedef-name</i> <tt>type</tt> denotes the common comparison
type (11.10.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/class.spaceship">[class.spaceship]</a>) of <tt>Ts...</tt>, the expanded parameter pack, or
<tt>void</tt> if any element of <tt>Ts</tt> is not a comparison category type.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
It more precisely states the behaviour, cross-references
11.10.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/class.spaceship">[class.spaceship]</a>, and uses the correct core terminology for the
metafunction that the template represents.

<p>
The alignment options specified in 22.14.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/format.string.std">[format.string.std]</a>, Table [tab:format.align] 
causes an inconsistency when formatting characters. The output differs depending on whether 
an integer is formatted using a character presentation type or when using a character directly:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
format("{:3}", '*'); -&gt; "*  " <i>// aligned at the start of the available space</i>
format("{:3c}", 42); -&gt; "  *" <i>// aligned at the end of the available space</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
I expect both calls to return the same value: <tt>"*  "</tt>. The current wording
mixes the type and the presentation type. To me, it seems clearer to adjust to wording 
to only use the presentation type. Another approach would be adjusting the wording to 
add an exception when an integer type uses the character presentation.

<p>
Due to the current specification of <tt>std::common_comparison_category</tt>,
<tt><i>compare-as</i>&lt;void, void&gt;</tt> is satisfied. And thus given two types <tt>T</tt>
and <tt>U</tt> with regular <tt>==</tt>, <tt>!=</tt>, <tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;=</tt>,
and <tt>&gt;=</tt> but irregular <tt>&lt;=&gt;</tt> that has return type <tt>void</tt>,
<tt>std::three_way_comparable_with&lt;T, U, void&gt;</tt> is satisfied.
<p/>
However, in this situation <tt>std::three_way_comparable_with&lt;T, U, void&gt;</tt>
can't be modeled, because <tt>Cat(t &lt;=&gt; u) == Cat(C(t) &lt;=&gt; C(u))</tt>
is ill-formed if <tt>Cat</tt> is <tt>void</tt> (see <a href="https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/5c4839qz1">this godbolt link</a>).
<p/>
I don't think this issue has any impact on meaningful codes, but it seems to be a hole in the
current specification.
<p/>
It seems that <tt><i>compares-as</i>&lt;void, void&gt;</tt> should be changed to <tt>false</tt>.
<tt><i>compares-as</i>&lt;NonComparisonCategoryType, void&gt;</tt> might need refinement.
<p/>
(Note: The same problem does not exists for <tt>std::three_way_comparable</tt>, because
<tt>std::three_way_comparable&lt;T, void&gt;</tt> can be modeled if the <tt>&lt;=&gt;</tt> on <tt>T</tt>
has "regular" definition or its return type is not a comparison category type, but the return value
has "regular" semantics)

 Consider the following code snippet:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
#include &lt;ranges&gt;

int main() {
  auto p = std::views::iota(0)
         | std::views::take(1)

<p>
<tt>r.front()</tt> is ill-formed even if <tt>r</tt> is a <tt>forward_range</tt>.
</p>
<p>
This is because the <tt>const</tt> overload of <tt>lazy_split_view::begin</tt> is not constrained by the

<p>
In order to remove the incorrect bi-convertibility of <tt>reverse_iterator&lt;int*&gt;</tt> and
<tt>reverse_iterator&lt;const int*&gt;</tt>, LWG <a href="3435">3435</a> adds two constraints to 
<tt>reverse_iterator</tt>'s converting assignment, namely
<tt>convertible_to&lt;const U&amp;, Iterator&gt;</tt> and 
<tt>assignable_from&lt;Iterator&amp;, const U&amp;&gt;</tt>, but since this function only assigns 
<tt>u.current</tt> to <tt>current</tt>, there is no need to require 
<tt>convertible_to&lt;const U&amp;, Iterator&gt;</tt> &mdash; the latter is sufficient.
<p/>
We should remove this constraint and be consistent with the <tt>move_sentinel</tt> and 
<tt>counted_iterator</tt>' converting assignment.

<p>
This was
<a href="https://lists.isocpp.org/lib/2020/05/16242.php">intentional</a>,
but I think we missed the fact that <code>counted_iterator</code> did something
else already. These should probably be made consistent one way or another.
</p>
<p><i>[Tomasz Kamiński commented]</i></p>

<p>
The <code>move_iterator</code>/<code>reverse_iterator</code> were present before C++20,
and this change restores their compatibility with C++17 code,
where only assignment was required.
They are materially different from adapters introduced with C++20,
and I believe we should put more weight into backward compatibility
than consistency with newer iterator wrappers.

<p>
ECMAScript says that <tt>\0</tt> is an ordinary character and can be matched. POSIX says the opposite:
<p/>
"The interfaces specified in POSIX.1-2017 do not permit the inclusion of a NUL character in an RE or 
in the string to be matched. If during the operation of a standard utility a NUL is included in the 
text designated to be matched, that NUL may designate the end of the text string for the purposes of matching."
<p/>
So does that mean <tt>std::regex{"", 1, regex::basic}</tt> should throw an exception?
<p/>
And <tt>std::regex_match(string{"a\0b", 3}, regex{"a.b", regex::basic})</tt> should fail?
<p/>
The POSIX rule is because those interfaces are specified with NTBS arguments, so there's no way to 
distinguish <tt>"a\0b"</tt> and <tt>"a"</tt>. The C++ interfaces could allow it, but we never specify 
any divergence from POSIX, so presumably the rule still applies. Is that what was intended and is it 
what we want?

</p>
<blockquote><p>
A valid value of type <tt>syntax_option_type</tt> shall have at most one of the grammar elements <tt>ECMAScript</tt>, 
<tt>basic</tt>, <tt>extended</tt>, <tt>awk</tt>, <tt>grep</tt>, <tt>egrep</tt>, set.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But then we never say what happens if an invalid value is used.
<p/>
What does <tt>std::regex(".", std::regex::grep|std::regex::awk)</tt> do? Is it undefined? Does it throw?
<p/>
It seems reasonable for <tt>basic_regex</tt> constructors to throw if <tt>f</tt> is not a valid value, i.e. 
for each non-default constructor:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Throws:</i> <tt>regex_error</tt> <ins>if <tt>f</tt> is not a valid value, or</ins> if [&hellip;] is not a valid 
regular expression according to the grammar specified by <tt>f</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
However, there is no <tt>regex_constants::error_code</tt> value suitable for this error condition.
<p/>
Also, the constructors say "<i>Postconditions:</i> <tt>flags()</tt> returns <tt>f</tt>." This prevents an 
implementation from storing <tt>f|ECMAScript</tt> in <tt>flags()</tt> if no grammar element is present in <tt>f</tt>. 
This seems like an unnecessary restriction, and forces implementations to do extra work to check if the 
<tt>ECMAScript</tt> grammar is in use. Arguably, it would even be better to require implementations to set 
<tt>ECMAScript</tt> in <tt>flags()</tt> if no grammar element was set in the flags passed to the constructor.

The standard doesn't say what it means if <tt>match_prev_avail</tt> is set. Table [tab:re.matchflag] says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<tt>--first</tt> is a valid iterator position. When this flag is set the flags

</p></blockquote>
<p>
What difference does it make whether <tt>--first</tt> is a valid iterator position or not? 
<p/>
What behaviour is changed when it's a valid iterator position? The standard doesn't say anything else about that. 
<p/>
When do the regex algorithms care about <tt>--first</tt>?
</p>

<p>
Examples like <code>regex_match("xa"+1, regex("^a"), match_prev_avail)</code>
and <code>regex_match("xa"+1, regex("\\ba"), match_prev_avail)</code>
are presumably supposed to inspect the character at <code>--first</code>
to determine if there is a match.
The standard doesn't specify that <code>*--first</code> is ever inspected,
only that it's a valid character

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Why is <tt>locale_type</tt> part of the regular expression traits requirements in 32.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.req">[re.req]</a>? 
When would <tt>locale_type</tt> not be <tt>std::locale</tt>? What are the requirements on the type? 
Does it have to provide exactly the same interface as <tt>std::locale</tt>, or just some unspecified 
interface that a custom regex traits type needs from it? Why is none of this specified?
<p/>
Currently the only requirement on <tt>locale_type</tt> in the standard is that it's copy constructible. 
Clearly it needs to be default constructible as well, otherwise you can't construct a <tt>basic_regex</tt>, 
since none of them allows passing in a locale, so they have to default construct it (see also LWG <a href="2431">2431</a>).
<p/>
The other requirements on <tt>locale_type</tt> are a mystery. Why do we allow custom locale types, 
but not say anything about what they should do? Can we just require <tt>locale_type</tt> to be <tt>std::locale</tt>? 
Is anybody really going to use <tt>boost::locale</tt> with <tt>std::basic_regex</tt>, when they 
could just use <tt>boost::basic_regex</tt> instead?
<p/>
Why does the regular expression traits requirements table say that <tt>imbue</tt> and <tt>getloc</tt> 
talk about the locale used, "if any". How would there not be one already?
<p/>
Why is imbuing a locale into a <tt>basic_regex</tt> a separate operation from compiling the regular expression 
pattern? Is the following supposed to change the compiled regex?
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::regex r("[a-z]");
r.imbue(std::locale("en_GB.UTF-8"));
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Hasn't the regex constructor already made use of the locale to compile the <tt>"[a-z]"</tt> pattern, 
and so changing the locale is too late? So do we need to do the following to compile the regex with 
a specific locale?
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::regex r;
r.imbue(std::locale("en_GB.UTF-8"));
r.assign("[a-z]");
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Why require two-stage initialization like this, is it just so that we appear consistent with the 
<tt>imbue</tt>/<tt>getloc</tt> API of <tt>std::ios_base</tt>? It works for <tt>ios_base</tt>, 
because the new locale is effective after imbuing it, but for <tt>basic_regex</tt> the pattern 
has already been compiled using the old locale and imbuing a new one can't change that. Is the 
<tt>basic_regex</tt> supposed to store the pattern and recompile it after <tt>imbue</tt>, or is 
this just an inappropriate API for <tt>basic_regex</tt>?

<p>
The semantic requirements of <tt>convertible_to</tt> express implicit
conversion by means of a function:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
To test(FromR (&amp;f)()) {
  return f();
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
and it requires that <tt>static_cast&lt;To&gt;(f())</tt> be equal to <tt>test(f)</tt> for some
equality-preserving function <tt>f</tt>. However, when <tt>To</tt> is a reference type
but <tt>FromR</tt> is such that the conversion binds the reference to a temporary, the 
<tt>static_cast</tt> is valid but <tt>test(f)</tt> would produce a dangling reference.
<p/>
We should rephrase this requirement to just perform the implicit conversion in words. Using a 
function handles the convert-<tt>void</tt>-to-<tt>void</tt> case, but the semantic requirements 
wording already excluded that case anyway.

Currently <tt>std::ranges::iota_view&lt;int, long&gt;</tt> uses its special <tt><i>sentinel</i></tt> type, as its 
<tt>W</tt> and <tt>Bound</tt> are different types and <tt>Bound</tt> is not <tt>std::unreachable_sentinel_t</tt>. 
However, as <tt>W</tt> (<tt>int</tt>) is not an iterator type, the iterator and sentinel types don't satisfy 
<tt>std::sized_sentinel_for</tt>, and thus not subtractable.
<p/>
IMO we should handle <tt>operator-</tt> overloads for <tt>iota_view::<i>iterator</i></tt> and <tt>iota_view::<i>sentinel</i></tt>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The Standard defines a number of types that are used to create overload disambiguators for constructors, 
like <tt>nullopt_t</tt> and <tt>allocator_tag_t</tt>. Values of such types are passed by value to such 
constructors to give it particular meaning. For pass-by-value these types need to be copy-constructible 
and for consistency should also be copy-assignable. Of those types the specification of <tt>nullopt_t</tt> 
doesn't clearly state that the type is copyable, 22.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/optional.nullopt">[optional.nullopt]</a>.
<p/>
The reason that <tt>nullopt_t</tt> is defined differently from other such types is to avoid ambiguity 
in expressions that assign an empty brace initializer to an <tt>optional</tt>.

<strike>
The meaning of such 
assignment should be to engage the <tt>optional</tt> instead of taking the braces to create a temporary 
<tt>nullopt_t</tt> for assignment and thus reset the <tt>optional</tt>.
</strike>
The RHS of such assignment should be a temporary empty <tt>optional</tt>
instead of a temporary <tt>nullopt_t</tt>.
<p/>
Types that aren't affected: <tt>nullptr_t</tt> (fundamental type), <tt>allocator_tag_t</tt>, 
<tt>piecewise_construct_t</tt>, <tt>in_place_t</tt>, <tt>in_place_type_t</tt>, <tt>in_place_index_t</tt> 
(all basically defined as a <tt>class <i>T</i> { explicit <i>T</i>() = default; }</tt> which works fine for pass-by-value)

<p>
I would prefer to see the wording use
<code>is_trivially_copy_constructible_v</code>
and <code>trivially_copy_assignable_v</code>,
which is consistent with similar usage of trivial-requirements in
<code>std::optional</code>.
</p>
<p><i>[Tim commented:]</i></p>

<p>
We need to say that it models copyable and is trivially copyable
(not sure if we need the latter but might as well - does anyone do it differently?).
"has a copy constructor" isn't enough - <code>T(T&amp;)</code> is a copy constructor.

<p>
According to 26.6.4.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.iota.view">[range.iota.view]</a>/15, when both <tt>W</tt> and <tt>Bound</tt> are 
integer-like, the expression in the return statement uses <tt>-<i>value_</i></tt> and <tt>-<i>bound_</i></tt>. 
These operations result in undefined behavior when <tt>-</tt> is applied to the most negative integer 
value of a promoted type.
<p/>
I believe that we can simply convert <tt><i>value_</i></tt> and <tt><i>bound_</i></tt> to the return type 
(<tt><i>make-unsigned-like-t</i>&lt;common_type_t&lt;W, Bound&gt;&gt;</tt>) and then perform the subtraction. 
Such method should give the same results with UB eliminated.
<p/>
Additionally, if we decide that <tt>iota_view&lt;uint8_t, uint8_t&gt;(uint8_t(1)).size()</tt> is well-defined 
(LWG <a href="3597">3597</a>), it should give the correct result. We can truncate the result to fit the type <tt>W</tt>.

Currently it is unspecified whether the definitions of <tt>std::reverse_iterator</tt> and its related 
operators are available in <tt>&lt;vector&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;array&gt;</tt>, etc. So, it's unspecified 
now whether the following program is well-formed because it's unspecified whether the equality operator 
is available:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;vector&gt;

int main()
{
  auto v = std::vector&lt;int&gt;(42);
  for (auto it = v.rbegin(); it != v.rend(); ++it);
  for (auto it = std::rbegin(v); it != std::rend(v); ++it);
}</pre></blockquote>
<p>
 Such underspecification also leaves the guarantee that <tt>std::rbegin</tt>, <tt>std::rend</tt>, 
 <tt>std::crbegin</tt>, and <tt>std::crend</tt> are available in some other headers seems not so meaningful. 
 In order to guarantee these function templates can be used meaningfully with containers, users are still 
 required to include <tt>&lt;iterator&gt;</tt> manually.
<p/>
I think the standard should guarantee that wherever the member <tt>rbegin</tt> (that returns <tt>std::reverse_iterator</tt>) 
or <tt>std::rbegin</tt> is provided, the definitions of <tt>std::reverse_iterator</tt> and its related operators 
are also provided. This strategy is already implemented by libc++, libstdc++, and MSVC STL, and thus I believe we 
should standardize it to reduce uncertainty for users.
<p/>
Note that the situation for <tt>std::reverse_iterator</tt> is different from LWG <a href="1361">1361</a>, because every 
operation on <tt>std::size_t</tt> is still valid when the typedef-name itself is absent, but <tt>==</tt> and 
<tt>!=</tt> on <tt>std::reverse_iterator</tt> fail if the corresponding declarations are unavailable.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
 Standard library headers <tt>&lt;typeinfo&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;initializer_list&gt;</tt>, and <tt>&lt;compare&gt;</tt> 
 are required for some core language features, as specified in 7.6.1.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/expr.typeid">[expr.typeid]</a>/7, 
 9.4.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/dcl.init.list">[dcl.init.list]</a>/2, and 7.6.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/expr.spaceship">[expr.spaceship]</a>/8. In C++11 (via <a href="https://wg21.link/n2930">N2930</a>), 
 every header that has dependency on <tt>std::initializer_list</tt> is required to include 
 <tt>&lt;initializer_list&gt;</tt>. The similar requirements are added for <tt>operator&lt;=&gt;</tt> and 
 <tt>&lt;compare&gt;</tt> in C++20 (via LWG <a href="3330">3330</a>).
<p/>
As N2930 and LWG3330 have been adpoted, IMO there are some inconsistencies in the standard library now:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No operation is done for <tt>&lt;typeinfo&gt;</tt>, although <tt>&lt;typeindex&gt;</tt> (<tt>std::type_index</tt>), 
<tt>&lt;functional&gt;</tt> (<tt>std::function</tt>, since C++11), and <tt>&lt;any&gt;</tt> (<tt>std::any</tt>) 
have dependency on <tt>std::type_info</tt>;</p></li>
<li><p><tt>&lt;iterator&gt;</tt> has dependency on <tt>std::initializer_list</tt> since C++14/LWG <a href="2128">2128</a> 
(the <tt>std::rbegin</tt> overload and its friends), but it is not required to include <tt>&lt;initializer_list&gt;</tt>;</p></li>
<li><p><tt>&lt;stacktrace&gt;</tt> is not required to include <tt>&lt;compare&gt;</tt> while it provides operator 
<tt>&lt;=&gt;</tt> overloads.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
The situation may be quite serious for <tt>std::type_index</tt>. Perhaps no expected operation on <tt>std::type_index</tt> 
is guaranteed to work when only <tt>&lt;typeindex&gt;</tt> but not <tt>&lt;typeinfo&gt;</tt> is included.
<p/>
libc++, libstdc++, and MSVC STL include <tt>&lt;typeinfo&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;initializer_list&gt;</tt> when 
the required standard interface depends on them. I think we should standardize the existing practice (except 
that <tt>&lt;stackstrace&gt;</tt> has not been implemented now) to reduce uncertainty for users.

<p>
Currently <tt>std::basic_stacktrace</tt> has an exposition-only <tt>std::vector</tt> member for 
storing its elements. According to 16.3.3.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/objects.within.classes">[objects.within.classes]</a>/3, it seems that it is 
effectively required that elements of a <tt>std::basic_stacktrace</tt> are contiguously stored.
However, the implication seems not used otherwhere. The iterator type of a <tt>std::basic_stacktrace</tt> 
is only required to be random access iterator.
<p/>
IMO if it is required that <tt>std::basic_stacktrace</tt> uses contiguous storage, we should 
explicitly strengthen some requirements, perhaps a the member function data should be added.

"The problem here is that a handful of member functions
(<code>operator[]</code>, <code>at</code>, perhaps <code>begin</code>)
expose references to the vector elements directly,
which can be read to require contiguity.
We should rephrase the members at issue to not do that."

<p>
Most uninitialized memory algorithms (27.11 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/specialized.algorithms">[specialized.algorithms]</a>) are specified by 
plain "<i>Effects:</i> Equivalent to:". According to 16.3.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/structure.specifications">[structure.specifications]</a>/4, 
such wording requires propagation of "<i>Constraints</i>" of selected constructors. The first two 
overloads of <tt>std::reduce</tt> (27.10.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/reduce">[reduce]</a>) are specified similarly.
<p/>
I feel the wording for uninitialized memory algorithms is incorrect, because it means that the 
constraints, especially for algorithms in the <tt>std</tt>, depend on "<tt>Constraints</tt>" in 
the specifications of many standard library types (but not any user-defined type), which is 
implementable but brings serious inconsistency.
<p/>
Perhaps we should add "<i>Mandates:</i>" to these algorithms (except for algorithms in <tt>std::ranges</tt>).

"P2. Not for this particular case (I'm pretty sure there'll be agreement
that this shouldn't induce any constraint), but for the more general
issue of "<em>Effects:</em> Equivalent to" propagating <em>Constraints:</em>;
I'm not sure that's the right approach in general (unlike the other elements,
<em>Constraints:</em> requires special handling beyond "use this code" and is
pretty hard to work through if we have a lengthy code block) - and it
certainly doesn't really make a lot of sense to propagate <em>Constraints:</em>
but not actual core-language constraints."

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
We have:
</p>

<pre>
template&lt;class ForwardIterator&gt;
  basic_regex(ForwardIterator first, ForwardIterator last,
              flag_type f = regex_constants::ECMAScript);
</pre>

<p>
and:
</p>

<pre>
template&lt;class InputIterator&gt;
  basic_regex&amp; assign(InputIterator first, InputIterator last,
                          flag_type f = regex_constants::ECMAScript);
</pre>

<p>
Ignoring the lack of proper requirements (which is LWG <a href="3341">3341</a>),
why does the constructor take forward iterators,
but the assign function takes input iterators?
Why could construction from input iterators not be implemented as simply
<code>assign(first, last, f)</code>?
</p>

<p>
The current constructor signature is the result of <a href="https://wg21.link/N2409">N2409</a>
which was resolving LWG <a href="682">682</a>.
It looks like the <code>assign</code> function should have been changed
at the same time, to keep them consistent.
I see no reason why they can't both take input iterators.
The meta-programming needed to avoid an additional string copy for the
input iterator case is trivial with <code>if constexpr</code>
and C++20 iterator concepts.

<p>
The specification of <tt>atomic</tt> and <tt>atomic&lt;T*&gt;</tt> (in 33.5.8.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.types.generic.general">[atomics.types.generic.general]</a> 
and 33.5.8.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.types.pointer">[atomics.types.pointer]</a>) explicitly deletes the following functions:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
atomic(const atomic&amp;) = delete;
atomic&amp; operator=(const atomic&amp;) = delete;
atomic&amp; operator=(const atomic&amp;) volatile = delete;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The intent is to make atomic objects not copyable, so that initializing an atomic object 
from another atomic, or assigning an atomic object with a value from another atomic, 
must be an explicit operation.
<p/>
We also explicitly support <tt>volatile</tt> objects of types that are specializations of <tt>std::atomic</tt>; 
some of the functions that are vital for the support of volatile atomics are the following conversion operators:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
operator T() const volatile noexcept; // for non-pointers
operator T*() const volatile noexcept; // for pointers
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The presence of this conversion operator means that all the statements in the following piece of code 
compile successfully today, despite the deleted functions mentioned earlier:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
volatile std::atomic&lt;int&gt; a;
volatile std::atomic&lt;int&gt; b(a);
std::atomic&lt;int&gt; c(a);
b = a;
c = a;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, if <tt>a</tt> is not a volatile object, none of the last four lines compile.

This PR would allow

because const volatile&amp; doesn't bind to rvalues. It sounds like we'll

Both <tt>std::pmr::new_delete_resource</tt> and <tt>std::pmr::null_memory_resource</tt> return pointers 
to static-duration objects. It seems unspecified when the pointed-to objects are destroyed, so users can't 
reliably use these objects during destructions of their static-duration objects.
<p/>
<tt>std::generic_category</tt> and <tt>std::system_category</tt> have the same issue, except that the 
referred-to objects may have different storage duration.
<p/>
Should we specify in which case can these objects be used in the termination of a program?

<p>
20.4.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/mem.res.private">[mem.res.private]</a> says that <tt>pmr::memory_resource::do_allocate</tt> 
returns "a pointer to allocated storage" and references 6.7.5.5.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/basic.stc.dynamic.allocation">[basic.stc.dynamic.allocation]</a>. 
But it's not really clear which parts of 6.7.5.5.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/basic.stc.dynamic.allocation">[basic.stc.dynamic.allocation]</a> define 
"allocated storage". <tt>pmr::memory_resource::allocate</tt> is not "an allocation function" 
and not a "replaceable allocation function", so "the value returned by a replaceable allocation 
function is a non-null pointer value" doesn't apply here, and neither does "different from any 
previously returned value".
<p/>
Is <tt>pmr::memory_resource::allocate</tt> allowed to return a null pointer on success? Is it 
allowed to return the same address twice, without an intervening deallocation? What about if you call 
<tt>pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource::release()</tt>, is that a deallocation?
<p/>
When discussed on the reflector the consensus was that returning null should not be allowed, 
it should throw an exception or return a valid dereferenceable pointer. The reference to 
6.7.5.5.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/basic.stc.dynamic.allocation">[basic.stc.dynamic.allocation]</a> doesn't work to specify this though, so we should 
restate the requirements without directly using the core wording for <tt>operator new</tt>.
<p/>
It was also suggested that returning the same value should not be allowed without an intervening 
deallocation, but that "deallocation" should not only mean a call to deallocate on the resource, 
but include things like <tt>pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource::release()</tt>, and when a memory 
resource's destructor returns memory to an upstream resource.

<tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt> provides a static member function that can be used to swap 
rvalues of type <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;::reference</tt> like so:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
vector&lt;bool&gt; v{true, false};
vector&lt;bool&gt;::swap(v[0], v[1]);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This is not useful. Nobody calls <tt>swap</tt> like that. This fails to make <tt>v[0]</tt> swappable with 
<tt>v[1]</tt> as per 16.4.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/swappable.requirements">[swappable.requirements]</a>. The similar SGI STL <tt>bit_vector</tt> class 
that <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt> is partially inspired by has a "global function" with the same signature, 
<a href="https://www.boost.org/sgi/stl/bit_vector.html">described as</a>:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
"Swaps the bits referred to by <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>. This is a global function, not a member function. 
It is necessary because the ordinary version of <tt>swap</tt> takes arguments of type <tt>T&amp;</tt>, and 
<tt>bit_vector::reference</tt> is a class, not a built-in C++ reference."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For some reason this became a static member function of <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt> in the C++ standard.
<p/>
We should restore the intended functionality, and deprecate the useless function.

<p/>
Some <i>Throws:</i> elements are specified to throw the exceptions an evaluation of <tt><i>E</i></tt> exits with. 
This wording excludes exceptions thrown involving the initialization and destruction of parameters 
of <tt><i>E</i></tt>, temporaries of <tt><i>E</i></tt>, and the destruction of the result of <tt><i>E</i></tt>.
<p/>
The proposed wording below fixes this with front matter. As if affects more than just <i>Throws:</i> elements, it talks 
about requirements and guarantees when <tt><i>E</i></tt> exits via an exception.
<p/>
As noted in the originating editorial issues, some LWG members prefer fixing each individual case 
of wording used to describe exception propagation rather than patching them up with front matter.

<p>
During the 2019 Cologne meeting the papers <a href="https://wg21.link/P1614R2">P1614R2</a> "The Mothership has
Landed" and <a href="https://wg21.link/P0645R10">P0645R10</a> "Text Formatting" have been accepted. P1614R2 adds
<tt>operator==</tt> to <tt>to_chars_result</tt> and <tt>from_chars_result</tt>. P0645R10 
adds a similar type <tt>format_to_n_result</tt> <em>without</em> an <tt>operator==</tt>. 
LWG <a href="3373">3373</a> reaffirms these three types are similar by ensuring they can be used in
structured bindings.
<p/>
It seems due to accepting P1614R2 and P0645R10 during the same meeting the addition of 
<tt>operator==</tt> wasn't applied to <tt>format_to_n_result</tt>. I propose to add 
<tt>operator==</tt> to <tt>format_to_n_result</tt> to keep these types similar.
<p/>
The <tt>Out</tt> template argument of <tt>format_to_n_result</tt> is unconstrained. Since
it's returned from <tt>format_to_n</tt> it's indirectly constrained to an 
<tt>output_iterator</tt>. An <tt>output_iterator</tt> doesn't require <tt>equality_comparable</tt>,
thus the defaulted <tt>operator==</tt> can be defined deleted.

Several votes for NAD. Unclear why <code>to_chars_result</code> is equality
comparable, but whatever the reason, this is unrelated to them and doesn't
need to be.

22.10.17.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/func.wrap.move.ctor">[func.wrap.move.ctor]</a>/22 and 22.10.17.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/func.wrap.move.ctor">[func.wrap.move.ctor]</a>/25 define the effects

<p>
The assignment via <tt>swap</tt> with temporary makes the implementation to do the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>move out the previous target to a temporary location</p></li>
<li><p>move in the new target</p></li>
<li><p>finally destroy the previous target.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
As everything is <tt>noexcept</tt> here, I think it can be short cut to just:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>destroy the previous target.</p></li>
<li><p>move in the new target</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Looks like the implementation cannot do such optimization in a generic case with small functor 
optimization enabled and non-trivial move constructor for the new target and with non-trivial 
destruction of the previous target, since the difference is observable.
<p/>
Apparently the optimization is precluded for no reason.

22.14.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/format.string.std">[format.string.std]</a> specifies the behavior of several format specifiers in terms of 
"integer presentation types"; for example 22.14.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/format.string.std">[format.string.std]</a>/4 states: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"The sign option is only valid for arithmetic types other than <tt>charT</tt> and <tt>bool</tt> or 
when an integer presentation type is specified". 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Unfortunately nowhere does the standard actually define the term "integer presentation type". The 
closest it comes is in 22.14.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/format.string.std">[format.string.std]</a>/19 and [tab:format.type.int], but that 
explicitly excludes <tt>charT</tt> and <tt>bool</tt>. [tab:format.type.char] and [tab:format.type.bool] 
then refer to [tab:format.type.int].
<p/> 
I can come up with many interpretations for what could happen when <tt>'c'</tt> is used with <tt>charT</tt> 
or <tt>bool</tt>, but the following table is what msvc does right now (throws is the same as does not 
compile after <a href="https://wg21.link/P2216">P2216</a> in all these cases, although not in general for <tt>'c'</tt>):

<p>
As you can see we don't interpret <tt>'c'</tt> as an "integer type specifier", except when <em>explicitly</em> 
specified for <tt>bool</tt> with <tt>#</tt>. I think this is because for <tt>#</tt> the standard states 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"This option is valid for arithmetic types other than <tt>charT</tt> and <tt>bool</tt> or when an integer 
presentation type is specified, <em><u>and not otherwise</u></em>", 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
and [tab:format.type.bool] puts <tt>'c'</tt> in the same category as all the other "integer type specifiers", 
whereas [tab:format.type.char] separates it out into the char-specific types. If this issue's proposed resolution 
is adopted our behavior would become non-conforming (arguably it already is) and <tt>"#c"</tt> with <tt>bool</tt>s 
would become invalid.

<p>
27.11.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/special.mem.concepts">[special.mem.concepts]</a> states that a type qualifies as a <tt><i>nothrow-input-iterator</i></tt> 
only if no exceptions are thrown from, among other things, <em>copy</em> construction and <em>copy</em> 
assignment. However, being copyable isn't part of the requirements for an <tt>input_iterator</tt> on which 
<tt><i>nothrow-input-iterator</i></tt> is based (indeed, one of the things <tt>forward_iterator</tt> 
adds to <tt>input_iterator</tt> is copyability), and the <tt><i>nothrow-input-iterator</i></tt> concept 
doesn't add any new constraints related to copyability.
</p>

<p><i>[2021-12-19; Daniel comments]</i></p>

<p>
During LWG discussion of the issue one argument brought forward against the proposed wording was that it 
might be incomplete, because it doesn't adjust the <tt><i>nothrow-forward-iterator</i></tt> concept, 
which adds among other things the <tt>copyable</tt> requirements. But 
<tt><i>nothrow-forward-iterator</i></tt> also requires <tt><i>nothrow-sentinel-for</i>&lt;I, I&gt;</tt>, 
which already extends this necessary no-throw requirement for copy operations by p. 4:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Types <tt>S</tt> and <tt>I</tt> model <tt><i>nothrow-sentinel-for</i></tt> only if no exceptions are thrown 
from copy construction, move construction, copy assignment, move assignment, or comparisons between valid 
values of type <tt>I</tt> and <tt>S</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It should also be emphasized that the definitions of move construction (3.34 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/defns.move.constr">[defns.move.constr]</a>) and
move assignment (3.33 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/defns.move.assign">[defns.move.assign]</a>) are compatible even for copyable input iterator types, 
because these definitions refer just to expression conditions, and not to concrete operator overloads. So as long
as an implementation applies these expression conditions, we are safe.

Is this program guaranteed to be valid:

<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;format&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;

struct Thing { };

template &lt;>
struct std::formatter&lt;Thing> {
  std::string_view spec;

  constexpr auto parse(std::format_parse_context&amp; ctx) {

</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In <tt>parse()</tt>, the formatter for <tt>Thing</tt> holds onto a string view of its specifiers. 
And then in <tt>format()</tt>, it just prints them. I don't think we say anywhere that this works. 
Does this code print <tt>"lwg issue"</tt> because there's no issue or does it print some garbage 
memory somewhere because there is one?
<p/>
libfmt's implementation internally stores <tt>string_view</tt>'s into the format string (for named 
argument support), which implies that it should work. But it'd be nice to come out and say that.

<p>
The specification for <tt>basic_streambuf::sputn</tt> is:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Returns:</i> <tt>xsputn(s, n)</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
One interpretation of this implies that <tt>sputn</tt> can't insert characters directly into the 
put area if there is space for them, it has to make a virtual call. That has significant overhead 
for repeated calls, such as inserting many small strings/string_views in a loop.
<p/>
But another interpretation is that it doesn't use "<i>Effects:</i> Equivalent to" or anything like 
that, so doesn't say an actual call to <tt>xsputn</tt> happens. Strictly speaking, it only says it 
returns the value that <tt>xsputn</tt> would return, and doesn't even have to produce any of its effects!
<p/>
We should describe the effects, not the return value, and we should do so in a way that does not 
overconstrain the implementation. It should not be necessary to make a virtual call to <tt>xsputn</tt> 
if the put area has capacity for the characters. On the other hand, if it doesn't have capacity, then 
calling <tt>xsputn</tt> is the best option; it allows the derived <tt>streambuf</tt> to decide how 
best to handle large writes.
<p/>
The proposed resolution replaces the <i>Returns:</i> element with an <i>Effects:</i> element, so that 
we specify that those effects actually occur. A normative remark is added to give the implementation 
leeway to avoid the virtual call when it isn't needed.

This will allocate temporary string, then copy one byte from it:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
std::string s;
s.append("a very very long string that doesn't fit in SSO buffer", 13, 1);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The problem is that there is no overload accepting an NTBS there, so it converts to a temporary string using:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
append(const basic_string&amp;, size_t, size_t = npos);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
C++17 added a new overload for a <tt>string_view</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
append(const T&amp;, size_t, size_t = npos);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
But that overload is constrained to not allow <tt>const char*</tt> arguments, so we still create a temporary string.
<p/>
If we're going to accept those arguments, we should do so efficiently, without forcing an unnecessary allocation.
<p/>
We could do better if we split the <tt>append(const T&amp;, ...)</tt> overload into:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
append(const T&amp;, size_t);
append(const T&amp;, size_t, size_t);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
and then remove the <tt>!is_convertible_v&lt;const T&amp;, const charT*&gt;</tt> constraint from the second 
overload (<b>Option A</b> in the proposed resolution).
<p/>
Alternatively, we can leave the <tt>append(const T&amp;, size_t, size_t)</tt> overload alone and just add one 
taking exactly the arguments used above. That seems simpler to me, and I prefer that (<b>Option B</b> in the Proposed Resolution).
<p/>
The same problem applies to <tt>assign("...", pos, n)</tt>.

<p>
The problem is that the new C++17 constructor:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
basic_string(const T&amp;, const Alloc&amp; = Alloc());
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
is an exact match, but the <tt>basic_string</tt> move constructor requires a derived-to-base conversion.
<p/>
This is a regression since C++14, because the move constructor was called in C++14.
<p/>
This problem also exists for <tt>assign(const T&amp;)</tt> and <tt>operator=(const T&amp;)</tt>.
<p/>
We can fix this by constraining those functions with <tt>!derived_from&lt;T, basic_string&gt;</tt>, so 
that the move constructor is the only viable function. Libstdc++ has done something very similar since 
2017, but using <tt>!is_convertible&lt;const T*, const basic_string*&gt;</tt> instead of <tt>derived_from</tt>.

<p>
20.2.9.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/allocator.traits.types">[allocator.traits.types]</a>/11 says that the instantiation of <tt>rebind_alloc</tt> is 
sometimes ill-formed, however, it's unclear such ill-formedness results in substitution failure or hard error.
It seems that current implementations (libc++, libstd++, MSVC STL) give substitution errors, and 
we should reword 20.2.9.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/allocator.traits.types">[allocator.traits.types]</a>/11 with "<i>Constraints:</i>".
</p>

<p><i>[2022-01-29; Daniel comments]</i></p>

<p>
This issue has some overlap with LWG <a href="3545">3545</a> in regard to the question how we should handle
the <tt>rebind</tt> member template of the <tt>pointer_traits</tt> primary template as specified by 
20.2.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/pointer.traits.types">[pointer.traits.types]</a> p3. It would seem preferable to decide for the same approach in both 
cases.
</p>

<p><i>[2022-03-04; Reflector poll]</i></p>

<p>
Set priority to 3 after reflector poll.
Probably NAD, since [allocator.requirements.general]/11 allows any allocator
instantiation to fail with a hard error outside the immediate context,
making it impossible to guarantee a SFINAE-friendly result.
Also unclear what motivation there is for it being SFINAE friendly.

Despite the fact that <tt>join_view</tt> may produce more elements than each joined view(s)

(per 26.7.14.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.join.iterator">[range.join.iterator]</a> p3), which may lead to UB. As we already have provided 
implementation freedom to define extended integer-like types we should make provision for them

<p/>

<p><i>[2022-12-18; Daniel comments and provides wording]</i></p>

<p>
It seems to me that we should differentiate the problems of <tt>directory_iterator</tt> and 
<tt>recursive_directory_iterator</tt> regarding the constructors that don't provide any <tt>options</tt> arguments
at least from a logical point of view:
<p/>
From the existing <i>Postconditions:</i> element of <tt>recursive_directory_iterator</tt> we can at least
guess that the intention of the existing wording is that these suppose to reflect that the effective options within 
the <i>Effects:</i> element are also equal to <tt>directory_options::none</tt>. 
But for <tt>directory_iterator</tt> we don't have any options "getter" nor <i>Postconditions</i> from deducing 
the intent. 
<p/>
Fortunately, existing implementations (I looked at the current V2 2022 library and libstdc++ implementation) 
seem to behave already as if <tt>directory_options::none</tt> is set for the affected constructors for both 
iterator types.
<p/>
Note that this issue here has some wording overlap with the the proposed wording of LWG <a href="2708">2708</a>,
I'm therefore using the exact wording form currently suggested there. If LWG would like to change this form (e.g.
by using the word "overload" instead of "signature") this should also be done in that other issue to reduce possible
merge conflicts. Note that the here suggested form using "signature" <em>has</em> existing practice in other places
of Clause 31.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/filesystems">[filesystems]</a>, so I recommend keeping that form.

(1) The proposed wording form takes care to be in sync with the wording form

touch the wording for the <tt>options</tt> function though, and leaves any changes

conclude that user code has no way to determine the effective <tt>directory_options</tt> value
of this iterator value (interestingly p15 quoted below can be read to apply here as well,
but 31.12.12.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/fs.class.rec.dir.itr.general">[fs.class.rec.dir.itr.general]</a> p2 seems to be very prohibitive and
LWG <a href="2708">2708</a> is going to solve this special case as well).<br/>
(3) We easily simplify the wording of p3 as shown below, because the "scope" of the
introductory new paragraph includes the <i>Postconditions:</i> element. But similar to
the arguments provided in (1) we don't wish to introduce merge conflicts with the 
LWG <a href="2708">2708</a> wording and therefore intentionally leave any changes of p3 to

Currently 31.5.2.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/ios.base.storage">[ios.base.storage]</a> p5 and p8 say "On failure, a valid <tt>long&amp;/void*&amp;</tt>

because an implementation may reuse the same <tt>long/void*</tt> objects on failure, and thus it's insufficient

<p>
In 29.11.5.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.zone.overview">[time.zone.overview]</a>, only defaulted move constructor and move assignment operator for 
<tt>std::chrono::time_zone</tt> are shown, other constructors are said to be "unspecified additional constructors". 
Presumably the intent is that the default constructor is not declared (suppressed) and the copy constructor is 
implicitly deleted, but it is not clear if they are not "unspecified additional constructors" and hence 
implicitly specified.
<p/>
On the other hand, the defaulted definitions of move functions bring almost no specification, as no exposition 
only member is shown. So it is unspecified whether these functions are deleted, trivial, <tt>constexpr</tt>, 
or <tt>noexcept</tt>. Perhaps we want these functions to be non-deleted and <tt>noexcept</tt>, while triviality 
and <tt>constexpr</tt>-ness should be left unspecified.

<p>
The issue reflected in LWG <a href="3679">3679</a> is not limited to <tt>&lt;ranges&gt;</tt> and 
<tt>std::ranges::istream_view</tt>.
<p/>
Example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
 #include &lt;vector&gt;
// some standard headers other than &lt;memory&gt; and &lt;memory_resource&gt;

template&lt;class T&gt; my_ator {/*definition, meeting the requirements of <i>Cpp17Allocator</i>*/};

int main()
{
  std::vector&lt;int&gt; v1; // Generally works. Is this guaranteed?
  std::pmr::vector&lt;int&gt; v2; // Usually fails to work on libstdc++. Is this intendedly permitted??
  std::vector&lt;int, my_ator&lt;int&gt;&gt; v3; // Generally works. Is this guaranteed?
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Currently libstdc++ only provides forward declarations of <tt>std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator</tt> 
in headers of standard allocator-aware containers, which means that users are required to include 
both <tt>&lt;memory_resource&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;vector&gt;</tt> in order to create a 
<tt>std::pmr::vector&lt;T&gt;</tt> object. If libstdc++ is technically conforming here, one may say 
the definition of <tt>std::allocator</tt> is also not guaranteed to be available in these headers, 
so <tt>&lt;memory&gt;</tt> is required to be included together with such a header to make 
<tt><i>standard-container</i>&lt;T&gt;</tt> work.
<p/>
Furthermore, the specification of allocator-aware containers are heavily dependent on 
<tt>std::allocator_traits</tt>. If these containers are not guaranteed to work when the definition of 
<tt>std::allocator_traits</tt> is not available, and the definition of <tt>std::allocator_traits</tt> 
is not guaranteed to be provided in headers of these containers, then users are effectively always 
required to include <tt>&lt;memory&gt;</tt> in order to create a container object, even if they are 
using their own allocators.

<p>
Currently (at least since <a href="https://wg21.link/P0593R6">P0593R6</a>), the <tt>allocate</tt> function of an allocator is 
required to create an array of elements (16.4.4.6.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/allocator.requirements.general">[allocator.requirements.general]</a>), which means 
the allocated storage must be properly aligned (otherwise the array of requested size can't be created). 
However, according to paragraph 12 it is also allowed that "the allocator also may silently ignore the 
requested alignment".
<p/>
IMO the allowance is contradictory and should be removed.

<tt>std::allocator&lt;T&gt;::allocate_at_least</tt> is a constexpr function that allocates memory during 
constant evaluation, but its restrictions is not clear. Presumably the restrictions are same as those of 
<tt>std::allocator&lt;T&gt;::allocate</tt>, and we should specify <tt>allocate_at_least</tt> in term of <tt>allocate</tt>.

The MSVC STL implementation returns <tt>allocation_result&lt;T*&gt;{allocate(n), n}</tt> now. Perhaps we

<p>
In <tt>lazy_split_view</tt>, the deduction guide that accepts two arbitrary types wraps the arguments in 
<tt>views::all_t</tt> (26.7.16.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.lazy.split.view">[range.lazy.split.view]</a>):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class R, class P&gt;
  lazy_split_view(R&amp;&amp;, P&amp;&amp;) -&gt; lazy_split_view&lt;views::all_t&lt;R&gt;, views::all_t&lt;P&gt;&gt;;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
When trying to use an <tt>input_range</tt> as the input, <tt>lazy_split_view</tt> requires the pattern 
type to satisfy the exposition-only concept <tt><i>tiny-range</i></tt>. Trying to use CTAD with an 
<tt>input_range</tt> and a <tt><i>tiny-range</i></tt> as arguments results in a compiler error, as demonstrated
in the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/37bs9hq1T">demo link</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
// Assuming `InputRange` and `TinyRange` are valid types satisfying the
// corresponding concepts.
std::ranges::lazy_split_view view{InputRange(), TinyRange()}; // Compiler error
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The underlying reason is that <tt><i>tiny-range</i></tt> requires the given type to contain a static member function 
<tt>size()</tt> that returns a number <tt>&lt;=1</tt> (26.7.16.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.lazy.split.view">[range.lazy.split.view]</a>):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class R&gt;
  concept <i>tiny-range</i> =                                          // exposition only
    sized_range&lt;R&gt; &amp;&amp;
    requires { typename <i>require-constant</i>&lt;remove_reference_t&lt;R&gt;::size()&gt;; } &amp;&amp;
    (remove_reference_t&lt;R&gt;::size() &lt;= 1);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
However, when given a range, <tt>views::all_t</tt> wraps the type in a <tt>ranges::owning_view</tt>. 
<tt>owning_view</tt> doesn't satisfy <tt><i>tiny-range</i></tt> for any template parameter because it 
never contains the static <tt>size()</tt> function required by the concept.
<p/>
A general resolution might be modifying <tt>owning_view</tt> so that it satisfies <tt><i>tiny-range</i></tt> 
when the given type is a <tt><i>tiny-range</i></tt> (that would require moving the <tt><i>tiny-range</i></tt> 
concept from 26.7.16.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.lazy.split.view">[range.lazy.split.view]</a> to 26.5.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.utility.helpers">[range.utility.helpers]</a>). A more 
localized solution can be to change the deduction guide in <tt>lazy_split_view</tt> to avoid wrapping 
a type satisfying <tt><i>tiny-range</i></tt> in <tt>views::all_t</tt>.

<p>
The internal iterator types <tt><i>outer-iterator</i></tt> and <tt><i>inner-iterator</i></tt> of 
<tt>lazy_split_view</tt> are default-constructible, but trying to compare a default-constructed 
instance of either of these classes to <tt>std::default_sentinel</tt> results in null pointer 
dereference (and, in all likelihood, a crash), as demonstrated in this 
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/cGs9jW1c6">demo link</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
// Assuming `OuterIter` is an alias for `outer-iterator` of
// some `lazy_split_view` instantiation.
OuterIter o;
o == std::default_sentinel; // Null pointer dereference

InnerIter i; // Similar to `OuterIter` above.
i == std::default_sentinel; // Null pointer dereference
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This is due to unchecked pointer access in the implementation of <tt><i>outer-iterator</i></tt> 
(26.7.16.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.lazy.split.outer">[range.lazy.split.outer]</a> p8):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
return x.<i>current</i> == ranges::end(x.<i>parent_</i>-&gt;<i>base_</i>) &amp;&amp; !x.<i>trailing_empty_</i>;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
(<tt><i>parent_</i></tt> is null for a default-constructed iterator <tt>x</tt>, making the access 
to <tt><i>base_</i></tt> invalid)
<p/>
And similarly for <tt><i>inner-iterator</i></tt> (26.7.16.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.lazy.split.inner">[range.lazy.split.inner]</a> p7):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
auto [pcur, pend] = subrange{x.<i>i_</i>.<i>parent_</i>-&gt;<i>pattern_</i>};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
(For a default-constructed <tt><i>inner-iterator</i> x</tt>, <tt><i>i_</i></tt> is a default-constructed 
<tt><i>outer-iterator</i></tt> member variable and <tt><i>i_</i>.<i>parent_</i></tt> is null, making the 
access to <tt><i>pattern_</i></tt> invalid)
<p/>
It seems a reasonable expectation for users to expect comparing a default-constructed iterator to 
<tt>std::default_sentinel</tt> to be a well-defined operation that returns <tt>true</tt>. Alternatively, 
the corresponding <tt>operator==</tt> functions should add a non-normative note stating that the 
iterator cannot be default-constructed.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The move constructor and the move assignment operator of standard exception types are not covered by 
17.9.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/exception">[exception]</a>/2, and thus it is currently effectively unspecified whether these move 
functions of <tt>std::bad_expected_access&lt;void&gt;</tt> are <tt>noexcept</tt>. Furthermore, 
<tt>std::bad_expected_access&lt;void&gt;</tt> has protected special member functions, which overrides 
(or conflicts with?) the general rule in 17.9.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/exception">[exception]</a>/2.
<p/>
The primary template <tt>std::bad_expected_access&lt;E&gt;</tt> stores an <tt>E</tt> object, and copying 
the stored object may throw an exception. Is it intended that the copy functions of 
<tt>std::bad_expected_access&lt;E&gt;</tt> are <tt>noexcept</tt> while those of <tt>E</tt> are not? 
When the copy happens because a <tt>std::bad_expected_access&lt;E&gt;</tt> is caught by value, if the 
copy constructor of <tt>E</tt> throws, <tt>std::terminate</tt> is called no matter whether that of 
<tt>std::bad_expected_access&lt;E&gt;</tt> is <tt>noexcept</tt>. But 
<tt>std::bad_expected_access&lt;E&gt;</tt> may be copied/moved in other circumstances.
<p/>
I think the move constructor and the move assignment operator of a standard exception type should be 
specified to be public and <tt>noexcept</tt> when they exist, although sometimes whether they exist may be 
unspecified. And the move functions should also propagate the result of <tt>what()</tt> when the source 
and target have the same dynamic type, except that they can leave the result of <tt>what()</tt> from 
the source valid but unspecified.
<p/>
Related to this, <tt>std::expected&lt;T, E&gt;::value</tt> overloads are specified to throw 
<tt>std::bad_expected_access&lt;std::decay_t&lt;E&gt;&gt;</tt> when an <tt>E</tt> is contained. 
However, it seems that the copy constructor of <tt>std::bad_expected_access</tt> is implicitly 
deleted if <tt>E</tt> is move-only, so the <i>throw-expression</i> is ill-formed.
<p/>
Is it intended that <tt>std::expected&lt;T, E&gt;::value</tt> is ill-formed in such cases?

<p>
30.4.3.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/facet.num.get.virtuals">[facet.num.get.virtuals]</a> stage 3 specifies that "by the rules of" various <tt>strto*</tt> functions, 
sequences of chars are converted to a numeric value (producing the "converted value" that is referred to).
<p/>
It then goes on to specify various error cases when the "field represents a value" that is outside the range 
of representable values. Clearly, the value that would be returned from the appropriate <tt>strto*</tt> function 
is not outside the range of representable values for <tt>long long</tt>, <tt>unsigned long long</tt>, <tt>float</tt>, 
<tt>double</tt>, and <tt>long double</tt>; therefore (unless if we expect no range-related errors for those types), 
the field "represents a value" other than the "converted value".
<p/>
Issue 1: It is too subtle to have two distinct values without calling more attention to them by giving them names 
aside from the prose descriptions.
<p/>
If the field "represents" a value other than the value that would be returned from the appropriate <tt>strto*</tt> 
function, then what value does the field "represent"?
Note that, strictly speaking, it is the process that results in the converted value that the wording says is obtained 
"by the rules of" the <tt>strto*</tt> functions, which is not the same thing as saying that the value represented is 
interpreted "by the rules of" the <tt>strto*</tt> functions.
<p/>
If the field "represents" the mathematical value, then for unsigned integer types, all negative values cannot be 
represented. This does not match existing practice.
<p/>
If negative integer values are interpreted using the rules of the <tt>strto*</tt> functions by obtaining the 
magnitude and then having it "negated (in the return type)", then the return type of <tt>strtoull</tt> is 
<tt>unsigned long long</tt>, meaning (where <tt>unsigned long long</tt> is 64-bit) that "<tt>-18446744073709551615</tt>" 
is <tt>1</tt> (even when converting to unsigned integer types of less width). That does not match existing practice.
It is also worth noting that negating in the return type does not work well if the magnitude is not representable as 
a positive value in the return type (e.g., for signed integer types and their most negative representable values).
<p/>
Issue 2: The effect of the minus sign with respect to unsigned integer types can reasonably be interpreted in ways 
that do not match existing practice (and are presumably unintended). The interpretation that works better for 
<tt>unsigned long long</tt> does not work as well for <tt>signed long long</tt>.
<p/>
If the field does not "represent" the mathematical value, then for floating-point types, it is unclear whether 
the minus sign takes effect before or after any possible rounding. For literals, the minus sign takes effect after 
rounding.
<p/>
Issue 3: The effect of the minus sign with respect to floating-point types is unclear.
<p/>
Lastly, for floating-point types with signed infinities, there are no finite values outside the range of 
representable values; therefore, conversions of all finite values to such types are specified to "succeed". That 
does not match existing implementation practice.
<p/>
Issue 4: The conditions for identifying range-related errors for conversions to floating-point types do not match 
the conditions that constitute overflow for floating-point types. There is implementation divergence: libc++ appears 
to check for floating-point overflow; libstdc++ appears to check for infinities.

<p>
Currently it is not clear in 16.4.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/contents">[contents]</a>/3 whether all possible overloads in the 
standard library are considered to be found "in the context of <tt>D</tt>". As a result, it 
seems underspecified whether a certain <tt>std::get</tt> overload is found by <tt>std::tuple_cat</tt>, 
<tt>std::make_from_tuple</tt>, <tt>std::apply</tt>, or exposition-only concept <tt><i>pair-like</i></tt> 
or <tt><i>has-tuple-element</i></tt>.
<p/>
There is implementation divergence: MSVC STL's <tt>std::make_from_tuple</tt> accepts 
<tt>std::ranges::subrange</tt>, but libstdc++'s doesn't, which is originally discussed in 
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=102301">GCC bug #102301</a>.
<p/>
IMO <tt>std::get</tt> overloads need some special rules: when referred by tuple-like facilities, 
overloads for <tt>std::variant</tt> should be excluded (or at least leave whether it's found 
unspecified), and all other overloads should be found; and the opposite rule should be used 
when referred in 22.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/variant">[variant]</a>.

<p>
Keys for elements of associative containers are presented as <tt>const</tt> subobjects, 
preventing their modification by user code according to 9.2.9.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/dcl.type.cv">[dcl.type.cv]</a> p4.
<p/>
However, that does not prevent those keys to be transparently replaced, for example via
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::map&lt;int, int&gt; map;
map.emplace(1, 2);
using KT = std::map&lt;int, int&gt;::key_type;
auto it = map.begin();
it-&gt;first.~KT();
new (const_cast&lt;int*&gt;(&amp;it-&gt;first)) KT(3);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This, of course, breaks the ordering of the keys, and should be undefined behavior.

IIUC LWG <a href="3234">3234</a> will be resolved by the recently approved paper <a href="https://wg21.link/P1467R9">P1467R9</a>. 
While considering adding the newly required overloads of math special functions to MSVC STL, I found 
that it may be more convenient to implement the whole overload set as a single function template.
<p/>
However, it's unclear for me whether the every "overload for each <i>cv</i>-unqualified floating-point 
type", or every currently separately shown overloads in the synopsis of <tt>&lt;cmath&gt;</tt>, is 
required to be a separated function. As discussed in 
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/issues/1335">microsoft/STL#1335</a>, if there were only a 
separated <tt>double</tt> overload (usually comes from the C standard library) and a fused template 
overload, calling the overload set with <tt>{}</tt> would be accepted, which is definitely ambiguous 
when there are separated <tt>float/double/long double</tt> overloads.
<p/>
I think it may be better to allow implementations to arbitrarily fuse the required overloads.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
MSVC STL's implementation of the <tt>std::quoted</tt> overload for <tt>const charT*</tt> calculates 
the length of the NTCTS and stores the result within the return value. Because the returned value may  
be output by <tt>std::basic_ostream</tt> specializations with different <tt>traits_type</tt>s, this 
strategy can be conforming only if all possible <tt>traits_type::length</tt> functions for the same 
<tt>char_type</tt> have equivalent return values.
<p/>
It seems not clear whether <tt>traits_type::length</tt> should be customizable. In a related PR, 
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/pull/2676#discussion_r861407001">Stephan T. Lavavej said</a> :
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
I argue that you've found a defect in the <tt>char_traits</tt> specification &mdash; it should say 
that whatever <tt>eq()</tt> does, it should consider <tt>charT()</tt> to be distinct from all other 
values, which aligns with the common understanding of how null-terminated strings behave.
<p/>
The original implementation and the <tt>char_traits::length</tt> change both handle arbitrary character 
types &mdash; the only difference would be for custom <tt>char_traits</tt> that consider null terminators 
to be equal to other values, which I have never seen used in practice (e.g. case-insensitive traits 
don't do this).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If it is decided that <tt>traits_type::length</tt> is customizable, then the implementation in MSVC STL 
should be fixed. Otherwise, we should explicitly require in 23.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/char.traits.require">[char.traits.require]</a> that 
whenever <tt>c</tt> is not "equal" to <tt>char_type()</tt>, <tt>traits_type::eq(c, char_type())</tt> is 
<tt>false</tt>.
<p/>
However, equivalence of two <tt>charT</tt> values seems not easy to specify, as there may be no 
<tt>operator==</tt> for <tt>charT</tt>, or the <tt>operator==</tt> behaves pathologically. IMO possible 
way may be
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>using the equivalence relation of value representations, or</p></li>
<li><p>using <tt>==</tt> and only imposing the requirement when <tt>char_type</tt> is an encoded 
character type (or more generally, a scalar type, while treating an enum type as its underlying type).</p></li>

<p>
Raised from editorial issue <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/5240">#5240</a>.
<p/>
The phrase "signed basic integral types" in 31.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/stream.types">[stream.types]</a> has been present since C++98 but 
never defined. It is unclear whether "basic integral types" are "standard integer types" or "integer types" 
(including extended integer types).
<p/>
As <tt>std::streamoff</tt> should be wide enough to represent the largest possible file size, and 
<tt>std::uintmax_t</tt> is used as the return type of <tt>std::filesystem::file_size</tt>, we should not 
disallow <tt>std::streamoff</tt> to be an extended integer type which may be wider than <tt>long long</tt>. 
On the other hand, as <tt>std::size_t</tt> and <tt>std::ptrdiff_t</tt> have already been allowed to be 
extended integer types, <tt>std::streamsize</tt> should also be allowed to be an extended integer type for consistency.
<p/>
So I think we should just use "signed integer types" instead of "signed basic integral types" in 
31.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/stream.types">[stream.types]</a>.

<p>
<tt>std::reference_constructs_from_temporary</tt> and <tt>std::reference_converts_from_temporary</tt> are only 
useful when <tt>T</tt> is a reference type, and a reference type is always complete. Whenever <tt>T</tt> is an 
incomplete object type, it's clear that these traits inherit from <tt>std::false_type</tt>, without any further 
detection which may result in UB. However, when <tt>T</tt> is <tt>X&amp;</tt> or <tt>X&amp;&amp;</tt> where 
<tt>X</tt> is an incomplete object type, UB may be needed because of the potentially problematic detection in 
<tt>std::is_constructible</tt> or <tt>std::is_convertible</tt>.
<p/>
I'm not sure whether the general rule in 21.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/meta.rqmts">[meta.rqmts]</a>/5 affects these cases.

<p>
As a resolution to LWG <a href="3070">3070</a>, in <tt>path lexically_relative(const path&amp; base) const</tt>, 
bullet 3.4 was added:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If: [&hellip;] any <i>filename</i> in <tt>relative_path()</tt> or <tt>base.relative_path()</tt> can be interpreted as 
a <i>root-name</i>, [&hellip;] returns <tt>path()</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This resolution was correct when we have really weird paths like <tt>abc\X:\c</tt>, but the MSVC standard library 
implementation treats UNC drive-relative paths as:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
\\?\C:\foo\bar = { <i>root-name</i> = \\?, <i>root-directory</i> = \, <i>relative-path</i> = C:\foo\bar }
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If we were able to go back in time, we might have <tt><i>root-name</i> = \\?\C:</tt>, but we can't make that 
change at that point without silently breaking users; therefore, we believe it would be best to instead change 
<tt>lexically_relative()</tt> to work around this issue.
<p/>
There exists a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/issues/2256">related github issue</a>.
<p/>
I don't yet have standard wording, but I think it would be reasonable to do something like:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If <tt>relative_path().has_root_path() &amp;&amp; base.relative_path().has_root_path()</tt>, and 
<tt>relative_path().root_path() == base.relative_path().root_path()</tt>, then 
<tt>return relative_path().lexically_relative(base.relative_path())</tt>.

There are two different definitions of multi-pass guarantee since <a href="https://wg21.link/P0896R4">P0896R4</a>. The old one (perhaps 
introduced by <a href="https://wg21.link/N3066">N3066</a>) seems less reasonable because it requires increment on rvalue iterators of

<p>
In bullet 1.1.4 of <tt>ranges::to</tt>, if the <tt>Container</tt> satisfies <tt><i>container-insertable</i></tt> 
and <tt>R</tt> models <tt>sized_range</tt>, it will first construct the <tt>Container</tt> with <tt>args...</tt> 
and then preallocate memory by calling <tt>c.reserve()</tt>.
</p>
<p>
However, this only makes sense when <tt>c</tt> is default-initialized. If instead the size of the <tt>Container</tt> 
created by <tt>args...</tt> is not <tt>0</tt>, the value passed into <tt>c.reserve()</tt> will be wrong, for example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
ranges::to&lt;std::string&gt;(std::views::single('o'), "hell");
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The size of the <tt>string</tt> created by <tt>"hell"</tt> is already <tt>4</tt>, whereas the size of 
<tt>R</tt> is only <tt>1</tt>, which makes <tt>c.reserve(1)</tt> useless.

"The intended use of those additional arguments is for allocators,

<p>
The specification of <tt>operator&lt;=&gt;(tuple, tuple)</tt> (22.4.9 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/tuple.rel">[tuple.rel]</a>) is described in 
terms of imaginary tuples (<tt>t<sub>tail</sub></tt>, <tt>u<sub>tail</sub></tt>, <tt>r<sub>tail</sub></tt>) 
which is a bit confusing. Indeed, It is not clear that these imaginary tuples need to respect the order of 
elements of <tt>u</tt> and <tt>t</tt>, nor whether the value category of the elements in these imaginary 
tuples can or should be conserved. It is possible to reformulate and simplify that description so that  
no imaginary tuple is involved.

The remark is copied from the similar wording of <tt>operator==</tt>

<p>
The bodies of both overloads of <tt>drop_view&lt;V&gt;::size</tt> are specified as:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
const auto s = ranges::size(<i>base_</i>);
const auto c = static_cast&lt;decltype(s)&gt;(<i>count_</i>);
return s &lt; c ? 0 : s - c;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Given the return type is specified with <tt>auto</tt>, the actual return type 
is the <em>promoted type</em> of the size type of the underlying view, which may be 
different from the underlying size type (e.g. if the underlying size is <tt>unsigned short</tt>).
<p/>
Note that <tt>take_view</tt> always has the same size type as its underlying view. 
So I think the difference on the size types is an oversight. On the other hand, the 
<tt>const</tt> used here seems redundant and inconsistent with other parts of the 
standard wording, although implementations may tend to use it.

<p/>
This is not a problem when the <tt>reference</tt> of iterators is actually the reference type. However, 
when the <tt>operator*</tt> returns a prvalue of non-movable type, <tt><i>tuple-transform</i></tt> will

The specification for <tt>copy_symlink</tt> is (31.12.13.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/fs.op.copy.symlink">[fs.op.copy.symlink]</a>):
</p>

where in each case <tt><i>function</i></tt> is <tt>create_symlink</tt> or 
<tt>create_directory_symlink</tt> as appropriate.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The specification for <tt>read_symlink</tt> is (31.12.13.29 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/fs.op.read.symlink">[fs.op.read.symlink]</a>):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Returns</i>: If <tt>p</tt> resolves to a symbolic link, a path object containing the contents of 
that symbolic link.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
And finally, the definition of a "symbolic link" is (31.12.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/fs.general">[fs.general]</a>):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
A <i>symbolic link</i> is a type of file with the property that when the file is encountered during pathname
resolution (31.12.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/fs.class.path">[fs.class.path]</a>), a string stored by the file is used to modify the pathname resolution.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
On Unix, <tt>symlink</tt> is the only kind of symbolic link. However, on Windows, there are symbolic 
link files which are <em>not</em> <tt>symlink</tt>s (app execution aliases and junctions) &mdash; this 
means that <tt>read_symlink</tt> should almost certainly get the target of these files if possible. 
However, <tt>copy_symlink</tt> specifically requires creating a <em><tt>symlink</tt></em>, not whatever 
type of file was there originally. IMO, <tt>copy_symlink</tt> should require its target to be a symlink. 
I think the original assumption was that <tt>read_symlink</tt> would take care of that for 
<tt>copy_symlink</tt>; this is clearly not the case on Windows, though.

<p>
This issue is raised from <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/5776">editorial issue #5776</a>.
<p/>
In order to achieve strong exception safety, some operations of <tt>std:vector</tt> and 
<tt>std::deque</tt> may use copy insertion for relocation of old elements, if move construction 
of its element type is potentially throwing and copy insertion is available. However, currently 
only <i>Cpp17MoveInsertable</i> is mentioned in many of their Preconditions (e.g. those of 
<tt>insert</tt> for rvalues), which seemly fails to cover the cases in which copy insertion is 
formally invalid but the semantic requirements of <i>Cpp17CopyInsertable</i> are not met.
<p/>
Perhaps we should create a new named requirement for these operations, which is equivalent to 
<i>Cpp17CopyInsertable</i> when <tt>!is_nothrow_move_constructible_v&lt;T&gt; &amp;&amp; 
is_copy_constructible_v&lt;T&gt;</tt> is <tt>true</tt>, and equivalent to <i>Cpp17MoveInsertable</i> 
otherwise.

</p>
<p>
Jonathan: I think the point (which LWG 3758 fails to explain clearly) is that today's implementations 
sometimes use copy insertion when move insertion is syntactically valid, but is potentially-throwing. 
But the preconditions don't require copy insertion. If <tt>vector::resize(size_type)</tt> decides to 
use copy construction, because move construction might throw and the type is copy constructible (which 
is implied to be permitted by the <i>Remarks</i>), do we require <i>Cpp17CopyInsertable</i>'s semantic 
requirement that the new value is equivalent to the one we copied? We don't say so.<br/>
tl;dr The user is trying to resize a vector and the value type is <i>Cpp17MoveInsertable</i> into the vector, 
but the implementation decides to copy not move. What are the preconditions on the user's type?

<h3><a name="3763" href="3763">3763.</a> Should range adaptor iterators only provide <tt>iterator_category</tt> when its

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
After <a href="https://wg21.link/P2259">P2259</a>, the range adaptor' iterators only provide <tt>iterator_category</tt> member when 
the underlying range models <tt>forward_range</tt>, which is mainly based on the premise that all valid C++20 
forward iterators meet the C++17 input iterator requirements.
<p/>
However, this is not strictly correct. When the underlying range's <tt>difference_type</tt> is an integer-class 
type, its iterator does not conform <i>Cpp17InputIterator</i>.
<p/>
Although <tt>iterator_traits&lt;I&gt;::iterator_category</tt> will still deduce the correct category in this 
case since these iterators have no <tt>reference</tt> member, it might be misleading to provide these 
incorrect member types. 
<p/>
Do we need to aggressively prohibit these iterators from providing <tt>iterator_category</tt> when their 
difference type is an integer-class type?
<p/>
The proposed resolution makes <tt>repeat_view::<i>iterator</i></tt> conditionally provide 
<tt>iterator_category</tt>, because it explicitly mentions <tt><i>IOTA-DIFF-T</i>(<i>index-type</i>)</tt> 
in the definition of <tt>difference_type</tt>, which makes it consistent with LWG <a href="3670">3670</a>.
<p/>
It also removes the <tt>reference</tt> member type of <tt>cartesian_product_view::<i>iterator</i></tt>, 
which prevents <tt>iterator_traits&lt;I&gt;::iterator_category</tt> from being aliased to its member 
<tt>iterator_category</tt>, so that <tt>iterator_traits&lt;I&gt;::iterator_category</tt> will not always 
be an <tt>input_iterator_tag</tt> when its <tt>difference_type</tt> is an integer-class type.
<p/>
This is also consistent with other range adaptors, as none of them have a <tt>reference</tt> member type.

Table [tab:locale.category.facets] includes the following two facets:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><tt>codecvt&lt;char16_t, char8_t, mbstate_t&gt;</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>codecvt&lt;char32_t, char8_t, mbstate_t&gt;</tt></p></li>
</ul>
<p>
However, neither of those actually has anything to do with a locale and therefore 
it doesn't make sense to dynamically register them with <tt>std::locale</tt>. 
Instead they provide conversions between fixed encodings (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32) 
that are unrelated to locale encodings other than they may happen to coincide with 
encodings of some locales by accident.
<p/>
The issue was introduced when adding <tt>codecvt&lt;char[16|32]_t, char, mbstate_t&gt;</tt> in 
<a href="https://wg21.link/N2035">N2035</a> which gave no design rationale for using <tt>codecvt</tt> in the first 
place. Likely it was trying to do a minimal amount of changes and copied the wording for 
<tt>codecvt&lt;wchar_t, char, mbstate_t&gt;</tt> but unfortunately didn't consider encoding implications.
<p/>
<a href="https://wg21.link/P0482">P0482</a> changed <tt>char</tt> to <tt>char8_t</tt> in these facets which 
made the issue more glaring but unfortunately, despite the breaking change, it failed to address it.
<p/>
Apart from an obvious design mistake this also adds a small overhead for every locale 
construction because the implementation has to copy these pseudo-facets for no good 
reason violating "don't pay for what you don't use" principle.
<p/>
A simple fix is to remove the two facets from table [tab:locale.category.facets] and make them 
directly constructible.

<p><i>[2022-09-28; SG16 responds]</i></p>

<p>
SG16 agrees that the codecvt facets mentioned in LWG3767
"<tt>codecvt&lt;char<i>N</i>_t, char8_t, mbstate_t&gt;</tt>
incorrectly added to locale" are intended to be invariant
with respect to locale. Unanimously in favor.
</p>

<p><i>[Issaquah 2023-02-10; LWG issue processing]</i></p>

<p>
Removing these breaks most code using them today, because the most obvious
way to use them is via <tt>use_facet</tt> on a locale, which would throw
if they're removed (and because they were guaranteed to be present, code
using them might have not bothered to check for them using <tt>has_facet</tt>).
Instead of removing them, deprecate the guarantee that they're always present
(so move them to D.28 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/depr.locale.category">[depr.locale.category]</a>).
Don't bother changing the destructor.

<p>
In case when <tt>cartesian_product_view</tt> is common and one of the inner ranges is empty, 
it needs to produce equal iterators from <tt>begin</tt>/<tt>end</tt>. We currently create a 
sequence of <tt>begin</tt> iterators as both <tt>begin</tt> and <tt>end</tt> iterators. This 
assumes that <tt>begin</tt> iterator is copyable, which may not be the case with the input range, 
even in the case if that range is common &mdash; in such case, we require that only sentinel 
is semantically copy-constructible, not begin even if they are the same type.
<p/>
To illustrate, C++98 input iterators (like <tt>directory_iterator</tt>) are syntactically 
copy-constructible, but only default constructed object, that corresponds to sentinels are 
semantically copyable &mdash; the copy produces an equivalent result. As a consequence for 
<tt>directory_iterator d</tt>, and empty <tt>std::string_view sv</tt>, the 
<tt>view::cartesian_product(d, sv)</tt> produces an invalid range.
<p/>
To fix the problem, we need to move the logic of adjusting the first range iterator to return 
<tt>[end, begin, ..., begin]</tt> for <tt>begin</tt>. This is safe, as we require the end 
to be always semantically copy-constructible. This again can be done only if computing the end 
can be done in <tt>&#x1d4aa;(1)</tt> i.e. the first range is common.

Discussed issue. Tim suggested to add a new semantic requirement to

then <tt>i == i</tt> is true for any non-singular <tt>i</tt> of type <tt>I</tt>.

<tt>default_initializable</tt>.
<p/>
In this case, since <tt>common_iterator</tt> itself cannot be default-constructed, it can never be a valid

which causes <tt>views::common</tt> to be unable to convert a <tt>range</tt> into a <tt>view</tt>,

I think <tt>common_iterator</tt> should always be <tt>default_initializable</tt>, 
which makes it eligible to be a legitimate sentinel.
<p/>
The proposed resolution provides a default constructor for <tt>common_iterator</tt> when <tt>I</tt> is

<p>
Algorithms <tt>std::for_each_n</tt>, <tt>std::search_n</tt>, <tt>std::copy_n</tt>, 
<tt>std::fill_n</tt>, and <tt>std::generate_n</tt> have similar requirements for the 
<tt>Size</tt> template parameter in <i>Mandates</i>, requiring <tt>Size</tt> to be 
convertible to an integral type.
<p/>
However, it is currently underspecified to which integral type <tt>Size</tt> is 
converted before further operations. There is implementation divergence:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/df4c584c567263fdcd57d8376f24f29477a892b2/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits/stl_algobase.h#L1005-L1052">libstdc++</a> 
and <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/3e97e9423742b8ad07358d01b63ffbedde23b2a4/libcxx/include/__utility/convert_to_integral.h#L24-L68">libc++</a> 
use an overload set to determine the target type, and</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/65aab97a8e75e7ba409002e518ed799006dfb285/stl/inc/xutility#L352-L353">MSVC STL</a> 
simply chooses <tt>std::ptrdiff_t</tt> when <tt>Size</tt> is not an integral 
type.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is also notable that when the conversion from the source type to integral types 
is sufficiently ambiguous, none of these implementations accepts such a source type.
<p/>
For example, currently the following program <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/KdK9dqWco">is rejected by all 
mainstream implementations</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;

struct BadFrom {
  operator short() const { return 1; }
  operator unsigned short() const { return 1; }
};

int main()
{
  int arr[42]{};
  std::for_each_n(arr, BadFrom{}, [&amp;arr](int i)
  {
    std::printf("%d\n", i);
  });
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
I think libc++'s strategy make the most sense. But is it really intended to support using a 
floating-point type or a class type as <tt>Size</tt>?
<p/>
<b>Daniel:</b>
<p/>
The conversion from class type was indeed intended, see the original wording for LWG
<a href="3213">3213</a>, which was transferred to <a href="https://wg21.link/P1718R2">P1718R2</a>.
<p/>
See also LWG <a href="3439">3439</a> for a similar underspecified situation for template parameter 
<tt>Distance</tt> and for the underspecified <tt>Size</tt> template parameter in
various <tt>uninitialized_*_n</tt> and <tt>destroy_n</tt> algorithms in 
27.11.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/special.mem.concepts">[special.mem.concepts]</a>.
<p/>
<tt>ranges::destroy_n</tt> has the luxury to simply require <tt>iter_difference_t&lt;I&gt;</tt>.

<p>
Currently, 31.12.6.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/fs.path.itr">[fs.path.itr]</a>/2 effectively requires <tt>std::filesystem::path::iterator::reference</tt> to be 
a reference type, due to the requirements for (legacy) bidirectional iterators. However, it's reasonable for the 
<tt>operator*</tt> to return <tt>path</tt> by value, which can make the iterator model <tt>std::bidirectional_iterator</tt>, 
be compatible with <tt>std::reverse_iterator</tt>, and avoid complicated data structures (e.g. those in libstdc++) 
for achieving such purpose.
<p/>
libc++ is already doing so. I think we should make such a strategy conforming.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
This issue came up when I tried to integrate the C++23 changes to tuple-like into <tt>ranges::elements_view</tt> 
in libc++. Given the following test:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
Using SubRange = ranges::subrange&lt;MoveOnlyIter, Sent&gt;;
std::vector&lt;SubRange&gt; srs = ...;  // a vector of subranges
for(auto&amp;&amp; iter : srs | views::elements&lt;0&gt;){
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The above code results in a hard error in deciding the <tt>iterator_category</tt> (The base is a random access range 
so it should exist). The immediate hard error complains that the following expression is invalid. 
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::get&lt;N&gt;(*current_);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Note that even if <tt>iterator_category</tt> does not complain, it will complain later when we dereference the iterator.
<p/>
Here are the declarations of the "get" overloads for <tt>subrange</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;size_t N, class I, class S, subrange_kind K&gt;
  requires ((N == 0 &amp;&amp; copyable&lt;I&gt;) || N == 1)
  constexpr auto get(const subrange&lt;I, S, K&gt;&amp; r);

template&lt;size_t N, class I, class S, subrange_kind K&gt;
  requires (N &lt; 2)
  constexpr auto get(subrange&lt;I, S, K&gt;&amp;&amp; r);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Note that the first overload requires <tt>copyable&lt;I&gt;</tt> which is <tt>false</tt> and 
the second overload requires an rvalue, which is also not the case. So we don't have a valid "get" in this case.
<p/>
But why does <tt>elements_view</tt> allow the instantiation in the first place? Let's look at its requirements:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class T, size_t N&gt;
  concept <i>returnable-element</i> =                  <i>// exposition only</i>
    is_reference_v&lt;T&gt; || move_constructible&lt;tuple_element_t&lt;N, T&gt;&gt;;

template&lt;input_range V, size_t N&gt;
    requires view&lt;V&gt; &amp;&amp; has-tuple-element&lt;range_value_t&lt;V&gt;, N&gt; &amp;&amp;
             <i>has-tuple-element</i>&lt;remove_reference_t&lt;range_reference_t&lt;V&gt;&gt;, N&gt; &amp;&amp;
             <i>returnable-element</i>&lt;range_reference_t&lt;V&gt;, N&gt;
  class elements_view;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
It passed the "<tt>is_reference_v&lt;range_reference_t&lt;V&gt;&gt;</tt>" requirement, because it is 
"<tt>subrange&amp;</tt>". Here the logic has an assumption: if the tuple-like is a reference, 
then we can always "<tt>get</tt>" and return a reference. This is not the case for <tt>subrange</tt>. 
<tt>subrange</tt>'s <tt>get</tt> always return by value.

<p>
I see two issues here:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: none">
<li><p>(A) The allocator-extended ctor of <tt>flat_map</tt> always copies the <tt>key_container</tt> and <tt>value_container</tt>, 
when it should be move-enabled.</p></li>
<li><p>(B) Almost certainly the <tt>Allocator</tt> parameter should be named <tt>Alloc</tt> instead, and there should be a 
separate "Constructors with allocators" section with wording similar to 24.6.7.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/priqueue.cons.alloc">[priqueue.cons.alloc]</a> explaining that 
these ctors don't participate in overload resolution unless 
<tt>uses_allocator_v&lt;KeyContainer, Alloc&gt; &amp;&amp; uses_allocator_v&lt;MappedContainer, Alloc&gt;</tt>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
I suggest this overload set to replace the two overloads above:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
flat_map(key_container_type, mapped_container_type);
template&lt;class Alloc&gt; flat_map(const key_container_type&amp;, const mapped_container_type&amp;, const Alloc&amp; a);
template&lt;class Alloc&gt; flat_map(const key_container_type&amp;, mapped_container_type&amp;&amp;, const Alloc&amp; a);
template&lt;class Alloc&gt; flat_map(key_container_type&amp;&amp;, const mapped_container_type&amp;, const Alloc&amp; a);
template&lt;class Alloc&gt; flat_map(key_container_type&amp;&amp;, mapped_container_type&amp;&amp;, const Alloc&amp; a);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This preserves the apparent assumption that <tt>KeyContainer(std::move(kc))</tt> is always efficient but 
<tt>KeyContainer(std::move(kc), otheralloc)</tt> might not be. Similar wording changes would have to be made to all the 
<tt>flat_<i>foo</i></tt> containers.

A number of functions in 22.10 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/function.objects">[function.objects]</a> and expressions in

are specified to result in a call wrapper. Most notably, the return type of 
<tt>ranges::to</tt> is <tt>auto</tt>, so its result is definitely a prvalue and not a "call wrapper" object.
<p/>
Where a prvalue result is meant, the wording should be clarified to mean

The standard requires <tt>subtract_with_carry_engine&lt;T&gt;</tt> to use:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
linear_congruential_engine&lt;T, 40014u, 0u, 2147483563u&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
where each of those values is converted to <tt>T</tt>.
<p/>
This appears to mean <tt>subtract_with_carry_engine</tt> cannot be used with <tt>uint16_t</tt>, because 
<tt>2147483563u</tt> cannot be converted to <tt>uint16_t</tt> without narrowing.
<p/>
What is the intention here? Should it be ill-formed? Should the seed engine be 
<tt>linear_congruential_engine&lt;uint_least32_t, &hellip;&gt;</tt> instead? The values from the 
<tt>linear_congruential_engine</tt> are used modulo 2^32 so getting 64-bit values from it is pointless,

<p>
This issue has its origin in the discussion of <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=107525">gcc issue 107525</a>.
<p/>
The current draft of LFTSv3 specifies this conversion function for <tt>propagate_const</tt> in 
3.2.2.5 [fund.ts.v3::propagate_const.const_observers]:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
constexpr operator const element_type*() const;
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-7- <i>Returns</i>: <tt>get()</tt>.
<p/>
-8- <i>Remarks</i>: This function shall not participate in overload resolution unless <tt>T</tt> is an 
object pointer type or has an implicit conversion to <tt>const element_type*</tt>. 
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
The constraint should however specify that <tt>const T</tt> (and not <tt>T</tt>) needs
to have an implicit conversion to <tt>const element_type *</tt>.
<p/>
Basically: if <tt>const T</tt> cannot do the conversion, then neither <tt>const propagate_const&lt;T&gt;</tt> 
should be able to.
<p/>
One can design a type <tt>X</tt> such as a <tt>const X</tt> cannot convert to <tt>const element_type *</tt> 
(for instance, by <tt>=delete</tt>ing the corresponding conversion function). If now one asks whether 
<tt>const propagate_const&lt;X&gt;</tt> is convertible to <tt>const element_type *</tt>, the answer is 
(surprisingly) "yes".

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
This issue is discovered when implementing <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/pull/3187#discussion_r1009941854">the 
<tt>span</tt> part of P2278R4 in MSVC STL</a>.
<p/>
<a href="https://wg21.link/P2278R4">P2278R4</a> added the <tt>const_iterator</tt> member type to <tt>std::span</tt>, which required its 
<tt>iterator</tt> type to model <tt>std::input_iterator</tt> (same for <tt>const_reverse_iterator</tt> and 
<tt>reverse_iterator</tt>).
<p/>
However, when <tt>element_type</tt> is <tt>volatile T</tt> and <tt>T</tt> is a class type, the <tt>iterator</tt> 
type generally fails to satisfy <tt>input_iterator</tt>, because:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p><tt>input_iterator&lt;iterator&gt;</tt> requires <tt>indirectly_readable&lt;iterator&gt;</tt>;</p></li>
<li><p><tt>indirectly_readable&lt;iterator&gt;</tt> requires <tt>common_reference_with&lt;iterator_reference_t&lt;iterator&gt;&amp;&amp;, 
iterator_rvalue_reference_t&lt;iterator&gt;&amp;&amp;&gt;</tt>, that is 
<tt>common_reference_with&lt;volatile T&amp;, volatile T&amp;&amp;&gt;</tt>;</p></li>
<li><p><tt>common_reference_t&lt;volatile T&amp;, volatile T&amp;&amp;&gt;</tt> is <tt>T</tt> (which is problematic), 
and thus <tt>common_reference_with&lt;volatile T&amp;, volatile T&amp;&amp;&gt;</tt> requires both 
<tt>convertible_to&lt;volatile T&amp;, T&gt;</tt> and <tt>convertible_to&lt;volatile T&amp;&amp;, T&gt;</tt>;</p></li>
<li><p>However, the class type <tt>T</tt> generally doesn't have constructors from <tt>volatile T</tt> or 
<tt>const volatile T</tt> glvalues, and thus neither <tt>convertible_to&lt;volatile T&amp;, T&gt;</tt> and 
<tt>convertible_to&lt;volatile T&amp;&amp;, T&gt;</tt> is satisfied.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Ideally, <tt>span</tt> should not require any form of construction of <tt>element_type</tt>. Although usages of 
class types provided by the standard library via <tt>volatile</tt> glvalues are generally not supported, I think 
<tt>span&lt;volatile T, E&gt;</tt> is still useful for some user-defined class type <tt>T</tt>, and thus shouldn't be forbidden.

<h3><a name="3829" href="3829">3829.</a> <tt>as_rvalue_view::end</tt> should improve non-common case</h3>
<p><b>Section:</b> 26.7.7.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.as.rvalue.view">[range.as.rvalue.view]</a> <b>Status:</b> <a href="lwg-active.html#New">New</a>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Currently, when the underlying range is not a common range, <tt>as_rvalue_view::begin</tt> and <tt>end</tt> return 
<tt>move_iterator</tt> and <tt>move_sentinel</tt> respectively, this seems reasonable since <tt>move_sentinel</tt> 
is a sentinel adaptor introduced by C++20 specifically for comparison with <tt>move_iterator</tt>.
<p/>
However, in the case where the sentinel type of the underlying type is an input iterator, this may lead to some 
performance issues, <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/8KGdqzzTK">consider</a>:
</p>  
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;list&gt;
#include &lt;ranges&gt;
  
int main() {
  std::list&lt;std::tuple&lt;int&amp;&gt;&gt; l;
  auto k = std::move(l) | std::views::keys;
  auto s = std::ranges::subrange(std::cbegin(k), std::end(k));
  (void) std::ranges::next(s.begin(), s.end()); // <span style="color:red;font-weight:bolder">constant time</span>
  auto r = s | std::views::as_rvalue;
  (void) std::ranges::next(r.begin(), r.end()); // <span style="color:red;font-weight:bolder">linear time</span>
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The above <tt>subrange</tt> is constructed by the <tt>elements_view::<i>iterator</i>&lt;true&gt;</tt> and 
<tt>elements_view::<i>iterator</i>&lt;false&gt;</tt> pair, and since the former can be assigned by the latter, 
when we use <tt>ranges::next</tt> to increment the <tt>begin</tt> of <tt>s</tt> to its <tt>end</tt>, the 
<tt>assignable_from</tt> branch will be executed, so we get a constant-time complexity.
<p/>
However, when we apply <tt>views::as_rvalue</tt> to <tt>s</tt>, the <tt>as_rvalue_view::end</tt> will go 
into the non-common branch and return <tt>move_sentinel</tt>. And because <tt>move_iterator</tt> cannot be 
assigned by <tt>move_sentinel</tt>, <tt>ranges::next</tt> will successively increment the <tt>begin</tt> of <tt>s</tt> 
until its end, we get the linear-time complexity this time.
<p/>
I think it is more appropriate to return <tt>move_iterator</tt> for the above case, as this preserves the 
assignability, but also preserves the iterator operability that the original sentinel type has.
<p/>
Another benefit of doing this is that when the sentinel type of underlying range can be subtracted from its 
iterator type but does not model <tt>sized_sentinel_for</tt>, returning different <tt>move_iterator</tt> makes 
them still subtractable, because its <tt>operator-</tt> only constrain the <tt>x.base() - y.base()</tt> being 
well-formed.
<p/>
This also solves the issue of <tt>as_rvalue_view</tt> being a valid type but does not model a <tt>range</tt> in 
some cases, <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/GM5sMarqP">for example</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;ranges&gt;

int main() {
  std::move_iterator&lt;int*&gt; i;
  std::move_iterator&lt;const int*&gt; ci;
  std::ranges::subrange s(i, ci);
  std::ranges::as_rvalue_view r(s); // not failed
  static_assert(std::ranges::range&lt;decltype(r)&gt;); // <span style="color:red;font-weight:bolder">failed</span>
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This is because currently, <tt>as_rvalue_view</tt> does not explicitly specify the template parameters of the returned 
<tt>move_iterator</tt> and <tt>move_sentinel</tt>, so based on CTAD, its <tt>begin</tt> will return 
<tt>move_iterator(move_iterator(...))</tt> which is still <tt>move_iterator&lt;int*&gt;</tt>, and its <tt>end</tt> will 
return <tt>move_sentinel&lt;move_iterator&lt;const int*&gt;&gt;</tt>. Those two types are not comparable, so <tt>r</tt> 
does not constitute a valid <tt>range</tt>.
<p/>
The proposed resolution is to return  <tt>move_iterator</tt> when the sentinel type of the underlying range models 
<tt>input_iterator</tt>.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In order to ensure that <tt>begin</tt> has an amortized constant time, when the underlying range is not a 
common range, <tt>reverse_view</tt> always caches the result of <tt>ranges::next</tt>.
<p/>
However, for some non-common ranges, incrementing its <tt>begin</tt> to <tt>end</tt> still guarantees constant time, 
for example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;ranges&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;list&gt;

int main() {
  std::vector v{42};
  auto x = std::ranges::subrange(std::counted_iterator(v.begin(), 1), std::default_sentinel)
         | std::views::reverse;
  (void) x.begin(); // <span style="color:red;font-weight:bolder">still caches end iterator in MSVC-STL</span>

  std::list l{42};
  auto y = std::ranges::subrange(l.cbegin(), l.end())
         | std::views::reverse;
  (void) y.begin(); // <span style="color:red;font-weight:bolder">still caches end iterator in both libstdc++ and MSVC-STL</span>
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In the above example, although neither <tt>subrange</tt> is a common range, applying <tt>ranges::next</tt> 
to their iterator-sentinel pairs is still constant time, in this case, there's no need to introduce a cache for 
<tt>reverse_view</tt> to store the results. We shouldn't pay for things we don't need to use.

"NAD as specified, the <i>Remarks</i> don't need to be precise, they already

"NAD, no need to complicate constraints for such contrived examples.

<p>
An <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/issues/3166">issue</a> has been identified regarding the two-digit 
formatting of negative years according to Table [tab:time.format.spec] (29.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.format">[time.format]</a>):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
cout &lt;&lt; format("{:%y} ", 1976y)  // "76"
     &lt;&lt; format("{:%y}", -1976y); // also "76"?
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The relevant wording is
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
The last two decimal digits of the year. If the result is a single digit it is prefixed by <tt>0</tt>. 
The modified command <tt>%Oy</tt> produces the locale's alternative representation. The modified command 
<tt>%Ey</tt> produces the locale's alternative representation of offset from <tt>%EC</tt> (year only).
</p>
</blockquote> 
<p>
MSVC STL treats the regular modified form symmetrically. Just as <tt>%Ey</tt> is the offset from 
<tt>%EC</tt>, so <tt>%y</tt> is the offset from <tt>%C</tt>, which is itself "[t]he year divided by 100

the above code will print "76 24" using MSVC STL. However, many users expect, and

gives, a result based on the literal wording, "76 76".

<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2008edition/functions/strftime.html">IEEE 1003.1-2008 strftime</a>
expects the century to be nonnegative, but the glibc implementation 
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/1jYoeYT9d">prints 24</a> for -1976. My own opinion is that this is the 
better result, because it consistently interprets <tt>%C</tt> and <tt>%y</tt> as the quotient and remainder 
of floored division by 100.

Howard Hinnant, coauthor of the original 29.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.format">[time.format]</a> wording in <a href="https://wg21.link/P0355">P0355</a> adds:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
On the motivation for this design it is important to remember a few things:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>POSIX <tt>strftime</tt>/<tt>strptime</tt> doesn't handle negative years in this department, so this is an 
opportunity for an extension in functionality.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a formatting/parsing issue, as opposed to a computational issue. This means that human readability 
of the string syntax is the most important aspect. Computational simplicity takes a back seat (within reason).</p></li>
<li><p><tt>%C</tt> can't be truncated division, otherwise the years [-99, -1] would map to the same century as the years 
[0, 99]. So floored division is a pretty easy and obvious solution.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>%y</tt> is obvious for non-negative years: The last two decimal digits, or <tt>y % 100</tt>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
This leaves how to represent negative years with <tt>%y</tt>. I can think of 3 options:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use the last two digits without negating:  -1976 &rarr; 76.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the last two digits and negate it:     -1976 &rarr; -76.</p></li>
<li><p>Use floored modulus arithmetic:            -1976 &rarr; 24.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
The algorithm to convert <tt>%C</tt> and <tt>%y</tt> into a year is not important to the client because these are both 
strings, not integers. The client will do it with <tt>parse</tt>, not <tt>100*C + y</tt>.
<p/>
I discounted solution 3 as not sufficiently obvious. If the output for -1976 was 23, the human reader wouldn't 
immediately know that this is off by 1. The reader is expecting the POSIX spec:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
the last two digits of the year as a decimal number [00,99].
</p></blockquote>
<p>
24 just doesn't cut it.
<p/>
That leaves solution 1 or 2. I discounted solution 2 because having the negative in 2 places (the <tt>%C</tt> and <tt>%y</tt>) 
seemed overly complicated and more error prone. The negative sign need only be in one place, and it has to be in 
<tt>%C</tt> to prevent ambiguity.
<p/>
That leaves solution 1. I believe this is the solution for an extension of the POSIX spec to negative years with the 
property of least surprise to the client. The only surprise is in <tt>%C</tt>, not <tt>%y</tt>, and the surprise in 
<tt>%C</tt> seems unavoidable.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In 32.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.general">[re.general]</a>, the character type used in the regex library (<tt>CharT</tt>), 
is only required to be "char-like". This means "<tt>struct A { int m; };</tt>" satisfies the 
requirements for <tt>CharT</tt>. Clearly there have to be more requirements for <tt>CharT</tt>.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Comparison operators such as "<tt>==</tt>" or "<tt>&lt;=</tt>" must be defined between <tt>CharT</tt> 
objects, because these operators are used at various places of 32 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re">[re]</a>, including 
32.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.req">[re.req]</a> paragraph 14 and 16, 32.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.traits">[re.traits]</a> paragraph 12, and 
32.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.grammar">[re.grammar]</a> paragraph 14. Similarly, "<tt>==</tt>" between a <tt>CharT</tt> object 
and integer 0 must also be defined, as it is used at 32.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.req">[re.req]</a> paragraph 11.

<p/>
Alternatively, we can also interpret these operators in the text, as code implemented using 
"<tt>std::char_traits&lt;CharT&gt;</tt>" comparison functions. This interpretation has the advantage 
of keeping 32 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re">[re]</a> consistent with the strings library and string comparisons, which are 
also used in 32 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re">[re]</a>, including 32.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.req">[re.req]</a> paragraph 7, 18, 20, and 
32.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.grammar">[re.grammar]</a> paragraph 14.2. Also, only with this interpretation, can
32.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.traits">[re.traits]</a> paragraph 3 be consistent with 32.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.req">[re.req]</a> paragraph 11.</p></li>
<li><p>There must be a way to convert between <tt>CharT</tt> and <tt>char</tt>, otherwise there is no 
way to recognize regex syntactical characters, such as <tt>'*'</tt> or <tt>'+'</tt>. One way is to simply 
do a type conversion from <tt>char</tt> to <tt>CharT</tt> (which requires <tt>char</tt> to be convertible 
to <tt>CharT</tt>). But this doesn't allow us to convert between character encodings.
<p/>
Alternatively, if we have an object of the <tt>Traits</tt> class (32.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.grammar">[re.grammar]</a> paragraph 2) 
denoted <tt>v</tt>, we can use "<tt>use_facet&lt;ctype&lt;CharT&gt;&gt;(v.getloc()).widen</tt>" to convert 
from <tt>char</tt> to <tt>CharT</tt>. This allows us to convert between character encodings. This requires 
that we can actually get this facet from this locale object.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Consistent uniform erasure added several overloads of <tt>std::erase_if</tt>. 
All these overloads have fully specified effects, and are either implemented
through the <tt>erase</tt>/<tt>remove_if</tt> idiom (for <tt>string</tt>, <tt>vector</tt> and <tt>deque</tt>),
through calls to the container's own <tt>remove_if</tt> non-static member function 
(for <tt>list</tt> and <tt>forward_list</tt>), or through a hand-rolled loop (for
the associative containers &mdash; <tt>map</tt>, <tt>set</tt>, 
and their unordered and multi variants).
<p/>
For the overloads that deal with non-associative containers the predicate passed to 
<tt>std::erase_if</tt> is always <em>copied</em> into the inner call
to <tt>std::remove_if</tt> or the container's <tt>remove_if</tt> (see 
23.4.4.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/string.erasure">[string.erasure]</a>, 24.3.11.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/vector.erasure">[vector.erasure]</a>, 
24.3.10.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/list.erasure">[list.erasure]</a>, 24.3.9.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/forward.list.erasure">[forward.list.erasure]</a>, and
24.3.8.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/deque.erasure">[deque.erasure]</a>).
<p/>
Now, algorithms are generally allowed to take as many copies of
predicates as they want &mdash; this is 27.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/algorithms.requirements">[algorithms.requirements]</a>/9, 
but cf. LWG <a href="3049">3049</a>. 
However it still feels strange/sloppy that a copy here is <em>mandated</em> by the Standard.
An implementation that would otherwise make no copies of a predicate in an algorithm 
<em>must</em> make a copy in the <tt>erase_if</tt> overloads.
<p/>
The copy of the predicate could be instead replaced by a move without
any change in functionality; after being passed to the underlying
algorithm, the predicate object is never used again by <tt>erase_if</tt>. 
I am therefore proposing to add a <tt>std::move</tt> call for the predicate object.
<p/>
One could argue that <tt>erase_if</tt> should be re-specified so that it is not
necessarily implemented in terms of underlying calls to other
facilities, and could therefore even remove the need of a move on a
high-quality implementation. 
This is a design change, and so I consider it out of scope for a library issue.
<p/>
Of course, moving instead of copying is a detectable change, and
"pathological" predicate types that are copyable but have disabled moves
will get broken, but I don't think those deserve to be supported.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The <tt>filesystem::u8path</tt> function became deprecated with the adoption of
<a href="https://wg21.link/P0482R6">P0482R6</a>, but the rationale for that change is rather thin:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"The C++ standard must improve support for UTF-8 by removing the existing barriers that 
result in redundant tagging of character encodings, non-generic UTF-8 specific workarounds 
like <tt>u8path</tt>."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The <tt>u8path</tt> function is still useful if my original string source is a <tt>char</tt> 
sequence and I <em>do know</em> that the encoding of this sequence is UTF-8. 
<p/>
The deprecation note suggests that one should use <tt>std::u8string</tt> instead, which costs me 
an additional transformation and doesn't work without <tt>reinterpret_cast</tt>.
<p/>
Even in the presence of <tt>char8_t</tt>, legacy code bases often are still ABI-bound to <tt>char</tt>. 
In the future we may solve this problem using the tools provided by <a href="https://wg21.link/P2626">P2626</a> instead, 
but right now this is not part of the standard and it wasn't at the time when <tt>u8path</tt> became 
deprecated. 
This is in my opinion a good reason to undeprecate <tt>u8path</tt> <em>now</em> and decide later on the 
appropriate time to deprecate it again (if it really turns out to be obsolete by alternative
functionality).
<p/>
Billy O'Neal provides a concrete example where the current deprecation status causes pain:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
Example: <a 
href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/blob/c8b580319539ded6028f09ba710db68534ab0148/src/vcpkg/base/files.cpp#L21-L45">
vcpkg-tool files.cpp#L21-L45</a>
<p/>
Before p0482, we could just call <tt>std::u8path</tt> and it would do the right thing on both 
POSIX and Windows. After compilers started implementing '20, we have to make assumptions about 
the correct 'internal' <tt>std::path</tt> encoding because there is no longer a way to arrive to 
<tt>std::path</tt> with a <tt>char</tt> buffer that we know is UTF-8 encoded and get the correct results.
<p/>
It's one of the reasons we completely ripped out use of <tt>std::filesystem</tt> on most platforms 
from vcpkg, so you won't see this in current sources.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The wording of 29.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.format">[time.format]</a> p4 seems to have some
unwanted consequences. It says:
</p>
<blockquote>
The result of formatting a <tt>std::chrono::duration</tt> instance holding a
negative value, or an <tt>hh_mm_ss</tt> object <tt>h</tt> for which
<tt>h.is_negative()</tt> is <tt>true</tt>, is equivalent to the output
of the corresponding positive value,
with a <tt><i>STATICALLY-WIDEN</i>&lt;charT&gt;("-")</tt>
character sequence placed before the replacement of
the initial conversion specifier.
</blockquote>

<p>
Taken literally, I think that means:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
format("{:%q}", -1s) == "-s"
format("{:%t%j}", -25h) == "-\t1"
format("{:%p%I}", -11h) == "-am11"
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The last one probably doesn't matter (what does -11am mean anyway?)
but some of them do matter, for example something like
"<tt>{:(%q)%t%Q}"</tt> intends to put the unit suffix first in parens
but will print <tt>"(-s)\t1"</tt> which probably isn't what the user wanted.
</p>

<p>
I think we want to place the sign before the first <u>numeric</u>
conversion specifier, not "the initial conversion specifier".
That is what Howard's <tt>date::format</tt> and &lt;fmt&gt; both do.

<p>
Currently, two <tt>iota_view::<i>iterator</i></tt>s can be subtracted
only when the underlying <tt>W</tt> type models <tt><i>advanceable</i></tt>, 
where <tt><i>advanceable</i></tt> consists of a series of syntactic and semantic
requirements similar to the <tt>random_access_iterator</tt> concept.
</p>
<p>
However, when <tt>W</tt> is an C++20 iterator type, whether it provides
subtraction is irrelevant to its iterator category. 
In such cases, still requiring <tt>W</tt> to support a series of random access
iterator-like operations seems too restrictive. Consider:
</p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;list&gt;
    #include &lt;ranges&gt;

    int main() {
      std::list l{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
      auto it = std::counted_iterator(l.begin(), l.size());
      auto r = std::views::iota(it, std::next(it, 3));
      auto sz = r.size();           // 3 as expected
      auto d = r.end() - r.begin(); // <span style="color:red;font-weight:bolder">error: no match for 'operator-'</span>
    }
</pre>
<p>
We can get the correct size of <tt>iota_view</tt> by subtracting two
<tt>counted_iterator</tt>s, 
but we cannot subtract two <tt>iota_view::<i>iterator</i></tt>s to get their
difference, even though the underlying <tt>counted_iterator</tt> already models
<tt>sized_sentinel_for</tt> for itself, which is not satisfactory.
</p>
<p>
I think we should relax the constraints of
<tt>iota_view::<i>iterator</i>::operator-</tt> to allow the above case,
which also makes it compatible with <tt>iota_view::<i>sentinel</i>::operator-</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Set priority to 3 after reflector poll.
Several P0 votes, but an objection to P0 on the basis that we don't
define what it means to use <tt>sized_sentinel_for</tt> on non-iterators.
Others responded that we don't need to, as we only use it with iterators,
and do not intend it to be usable with anything else.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In order to preserve room for optimization, the standard always tries to
propagate the <tt>noexcept</tt> specification of custom
<tt>iter_move</tt>/<tt>iter_swap</tt> for different iterators.
</p>
<p>But for <tt>join_with_view::<i>iterator</i></tt>,
these two specializations are the only ones in the standard that do not have
a <tt>noexcept</tt> specification.
This is because both invoke <tt>visit</tt> in the function body,
and <tt>visit</tt> may throw an exception when the <tt>variant</tt>
does not hold a value.
</p>
<p>
However, implementors are not required to follow the standard practice.
Since the <tt>join_with_view::<i>iterator</i></tt>'s <tt>variant</tt> member
only contains two alternative types, both libstdc++ and MSVC-STL avoid
heavyweight <tt>visit</tt> calls by simply using multiple if statements.
This means that it is still possible to add a conditional <tt>noexcept</tt>
specification to these overloads, and there is already a precedent in the
standard, namely <tt>common_iterator</tt>.
All we need to do is add a <i>Preconditions</i>.
</p>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Some standard library types, such as <tt>std::pair</tt>, <tt>std::tuple</tt>, and <tt>std::array</tt>, 
are currently allowed to have a member or element type with a destructor that is <tt>noexcept(false)</tt>. 
In order to conform to 16.4.6.13 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/res.on.exception.handling">[res.on.exception.handling]</a>/3, these types can't always have 
implicitly declared destructors because the implicit exception specification may be <tt>noexcept(false)</tt>.
<p/>
However, it may be intentional to implement these types with implicitly declared destructors, and 
mainstream implementations (libc++, libstdc++, and MSVC STL) are already doing so.
<p/>
Furtherly, explicitly declared destructors are not allowed for algorithm result types 
(27.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/algorithms.results">[algorithms.results]</a>), while currently these class templates are allowed to be instantiated 
with classes with potentially throwing destructors, which is contradictory to 16.4.6.13 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/res.on.exception.handling">[res.on.exception.handling]</a>/3.

Unclear who the "shall" imposes requirements on. Maybe split into constraint
on the library to not put <tt>noexcept(false)</tt> on destructors, and
constraint on users that the library can assume destructors don't throw.
Should also make it clear which parts of the subclause are normative and
which are not.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Currently, <tt>lazy_split_view</tt> supports input range when the element of the pattern is less than or equal to 1. 
In order to ensure this condition at compile time, <tt><i>tiny-range</i></tt> constrains the type <tt>R</tt> to model 
<tt>sized_range</tt> and requires <tt>(remove_reference_t&lt;R&gt;::size() &lt;= 1)</tt> to be a constant expression.
<p/>
However, modeling a <tt>sized_range</tt> does not guarantee that <tt>ranges::size</tt> will be evaluated by <tt>R::size()</tt>.
For example, when <tt>disable_sized_range&lt;R&gt;</tt> is specialized to <tt>true</tt> or <tt>R::size()</tt> returns a non-integer-like type, 
<tt>ranges::size</tt> can still compute the size by subtracting the iterator-sentinel pair when both satisfy <tt>sized_sentinel_for</tt>.
<p/>
Since the <tt>lazy_split_view</tt>'s iterator uses <tt>R::size()</tt> to get the constant value of the pattern, 
we must ensure that this is indeed how <tt>ranges::size</tt> is calculated. Also, I think we can simplify 
<tt><i>tiny-range</i></tt> with <tt>bool_constant</tt> in a way similar to LWG <a href="3150">3150</a>, which removes the 
introduction of <tt><i>require-constant</i></tt>.
</p>

<p><i>[2023-02-01; Reflector poll]</i></p>

<p>
Set priority to 4 after reflector poll.
Only matters for pathological types.
Maybe use <tt>requires bool_constant&lt;ranges::size(r) &lt;= 1&gt;</tt>.

29.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.format">[time.format]</a>/6:
<blockquote>
If the type being formatted does not contain the information that the format
flag needs, an exception of type <tt>format_error</tt> is thrown.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
It's unclear how to determine if a type contain the needed information,
and implementations diverge.
</p>

<p>
For example, consider
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;chrono&gt;
#include &lt;format&gt;

auto f(std::chrono::month_day_last mdl) {
  return std::format("{:%j}", mdl);
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both libstdc++ and libc++ produce a compile-time error, claiming that the
argument does not contain the information, while MSVC STL throws
<tt>format_error</tt> at run time unless <tt>mdl</tt> is `January/last`,
in which case the function returns "031".
</p>
<p>
Another interesting case is <code>format("{:%d}", mdl)</code> where the value
can be printed for all months <i>except</i> February, which requires a year
to know how many days it has.
</p>

<p>
A related example from Jonathan Wakely:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::chrono::weekday_indexed wdi(Monday, 7);  // 7th Monday in the month
assert( ! wdi.ok() );
assert( wdi.weekday().ok() );
std::format("{:%a}", wdi);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
For <tt>%a</tt> the required information is "a valid weekday",
and arguably this does contain a valid weekday.
On the other hand, there's no 7th Monday, so this isn't valid.
Should this throw or not?
</p>
<p>
This was discussed by LWG and Howard Hinnant summarized the intended behaviour as:
<blockquote>
"The intention of 29.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.format">[time.format]</a>/6 is to address things like
formatting a <tt>duration</tt> with <tt>%F</tt>. A <tt>duration</tt> doesn't contain
the calendrical information that <tt>%F</tt> requires (year, month, day).
Ditto for using <tt>%a</tt> (weekday name) with a <tt>year</tt>.
It is meant to address mismatching <i>types</i> and flags,
and not meant to address <i>values</i>."
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
The type <tt>chrono::weekday</tt> does contain the information needed to print
a weekday. A specific invalid value doesn't change that.
The type <tt>chrono::month_day_last</tt> does not contain the information
needed to print the day of the year.
A specific value where the day can be known doesn't change that.
The day of month is more interesting, and might need more discussion.
</p>
<p>
Jonathan proposed adding more examples to clarify the intention that only the
type matters, and not the value. There is some redundancy between p3 and p6.
Referring to "the formatted object" in p3 seems unclear.
Saying "type" as in p6 is better.
But p6 refers to "format flag" which is not defined,
whereas p3 uses "conversion specifier" (defined at the start of that paragraph).
The two uses of "flag" in p6 look like remnants from the earlier <tt>chrono::format</tt> 
feature that was replaced by integration with <tt>std::format</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;ranges&gt;

struct Abstract {

struct Concrete : Abstract {

<p>
Here, <tt>xformed</tt> is a range whose reference type is <tt>Abstract&amp;</tt> and whose <tt>value_type</tt> is <tt>Abstract</tt>. 
Even though you can't actually create a value of that <tt>value_type</tt>, that's okay here, because no code is actually trying to do so.
<p/>
On the other hand, <tt>zipped</tt> is a range whose reference type is <tt>std::tuple&lt;Abstract&amp;&gt;</tt> and whose 
<tt>value_type</tt> is <tt>std::tuple&lt;Abstract&gt;</tt>. No code here is actually trying to construct a <tt>value_type</tt> either, 
but this code fails because simply instantiating <tt>std::tuple&lt;Abstract&gt;</tt> is an error. There's no other possible 
<tt>value_type</tt> for <tt>zipped</tt> to have, <tt>std::tuple&lt;Abstract&gt;</tt> is correct &mdash; it's just that it happens 
to be an ill-formed type in this context. There are workarounds for this case &mdash; you would have to make <tt>xformed</tt> 
be a range of <tt>Abstract*</tt> or, probably better, a range of <tt>reference_wrapper&lt;Abstract&gt;</tt> instead. 
<p/>
This is unfortunate because many (most?) algorithms don't actually make any use of a range's <tt>value_type</tt>. The ones that do 
(like <tt>ranges::min</tt>) obviously could not work, but currently we end up rejecting all uses. Probably the only possible way to 
make this work is to allow <tt>value_type</tt> to be <tt>void</tt> (or absent), but it is currently a fairly fundamental type due 
to its use in <tt>indirectly_readable</tt> to identify input iterators.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In C++20, <tt>output_iterator</tt> is required to support <tt>*o++ = t</tt> mainly for backward compatibility,
that is to say, in addition to avoiding needless breakage, this semantic is actually not very useful, as it can 
be equivalently replaced by <tt>*o = t; ++o;</tt>.
<p/>
This is reflected in the current implementation for constrained algorithms in libstdc++ and MSVC-STL. 
Even if the algorithm explicitly requires <tt>output_iterator</tt>, there is no code of the form <tt>*o++ = t</tt> in practice,
and the latter of a more generic form is used instead.
<p/>
It seems to me that constrained algorithms should never require <tt>output_iterator</tt>, since there really isn't
any desirable reason to use <tt>*o++ = t</tt> in the new iterator system.
It would be more appropriate to relax <tt>output_iterator</tt> to <tt>weakly_incrementable</tt> 
(or <tt>input_or_output_iterator</tt>) and <tt>indirectly_writable</tt>,
given that many constrained algorithms already do that.

In order to ensure that the pattern range is compatible with the inner range, 
<tt>join_with_view</tt> requires that the two range types must satisfy <tt><i>compatible-joinable-ranges</i></tt>, 
which requires that the value type, reference type, and rvalue reference type of the two range types share a common type.

<p>
Is defined as a non-member non-friend function that "is to be found via argument-dependent lookup only."
<p/>
The intent is that it should be defined as a hidden friend in <tt>tuple</tt>.
<p/>
The current specification is confusing as to which class should contain that hidden friend, or how to otherwise 
implement that adl only restriction. (An hostile reading may consider it to be a hidden friend of <tt>UTuple</tt>), 
and does not follow the guidance of <a href="https://wg21.link/P1601">P1601</a> "Recommendations for Specifying ``Hidden Friends''".
<p/>
We should consider making these <tt>operator==</tt> and <tt>operator&lt;=&gt;</tt> overloads hidden friends of 
<tt>tuple</tt>, i.e.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::tuple {
  template&lt;class... TTypes, <i>tuple-like</i> UTuple&gt;

<p><i>[2023-03-05; Daniel comments and provides improved wording]</i></p>

<p>
The revised wording ensures that no ambiguity exists between the overload candidates, furthermore the additional wording about
being found via argument-dependent lookup only has been eliminated, because the general conventions of 16.4.6.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/hidden.friends">[hidden.friends]</a>
apply. 
<p/>
The reusage of the exposition-only concept <tt><i>different-from</i></tt> is already existing practice in various places of 
22.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/tuple">[tuple]</a>. We have also existing wording practice where we have an extra <i>Constraints:</i> element added even though 
a prototype has already a language constraint as part of its signature.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In 17.14.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/support.c.headers.other">[support.c.headers.other]</a>, it states that the <tt>&lt;<i>name</i>.h&gt;</tt> headers behave 
"as if each name placed in the standard library namespace by the corresponding header is placed within the 
global namespace scope". There are exceptions for several different definitions in the headers, but it's left 
ambiguous as to whether their inclusion in the <tt>&lt;<i>name</i>.h&gt;</tt> headers is required or unspecified.
<p/>
While it is clear that, for example, <tt>::byte</tt> is prohibited, it isn't clear whether <tt>std::byte</tt> 
is required to be included at all (this applies to the other listed exceptions as well). Though example 1 makes 
it appear that their inclusion requirements are meant to be left unspecified, paragraph 1 does not provide clarification. 
Adding specific wording will ensure this will not be misinterpreted in the future.
<p/>
To do this, we should append a sentence to [support.c.headers.other] p1:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Whether the listed exceptions are included in their corresponding <tt>&lt;<i>name</i>.h&gt;</tt> headers under 
the standard library namespace is unspecified.
</p></blockquote>

"The new wording is confusingly inconsistent with the existing wording
in that paragraph. Would prefer '... Whether the listed exceptions are declared

headers is unspecified.'."

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
While implementing <a href="https://wg21.link/P2505R5">P2505R5</a> "Monadic Functions for <tt>std::expected</tt>" we found it odd that
the template type parameter for the assignment operator that accepts an argument by forwarding reference is
defaulted, but the template type parameter for <tt>value_or</tt> is not. For consistency, it would seem that
<tt><i>meow</i>.value_or(<i>woof</i>)</tt> should accept the same arguments <tt><i>woof</i></tt> as does
<tt><i>meow</i> = <i>woof</i></tt>, even when those arguments are braced-initializers.
<p/>
That said, it would be peculiar to default the template type parameter of <tt>value_or</tt> to <tt>T</tt>
instead of <tt>remove_cv_t&lt;T&gt;</tt>. For <tt>expected&lt;const vector&lt;int&gt;, int&gt; <i>meow</i>{unexpect, 42};</tt>,
for example, <tt><i>meow</i>.value_or({1, 2, 3})</tt> would create a temporary <tt>const vector&lt;int&gt;</tt>
for the argument and return a copy of that argument. Were the default template argument instead
<tt>remove_cv_t&lt;T&gt;</tt>, <tt><i>meow</i>.value_or({1, 2, 3})</tt> could move construct its return value
from the argument <tt>vector&lt;int&gt;</tt>. For the same reason, the constructor that accepts a forwarding
reference with a default template argument of <tt>T</tt> should default that argument to <tt>remove_cv_t&lt;T&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
For consistency, it would be best to default the template argument of the perfect-forwarding construct,
perfect-forwarding assignment operator, and <tt>value_or</tt> to <tt>remove_cv_t&lt;T&gt;</tt>. Since all of
the arguments presented apply equally to <tt>optional</tt>, we believe <tt>optional</tt> should be changed
consistently with <tt>expected</tt>. MSVCSTL has prototyped these changes successfully.

<p><i>[2023-02-26; Daniel comments and provides alternative wording]</i></p>

<p>
The suggested fix indeed corrects an inconsistency, but also implies a silent behaviour change at runtime, since at least MSVC STL and
libstdc++ implement the array destruction order as specified (others not tested). 
The below wording therefore suggests to introduce a specific feature macro for this, so that user code can potentially react on this,
regardless of potential vendor API breakage hesitations. 
The natural feature macro to increase would be that which introduced the specific array destruction behavior of <tt>destroy_at</tt>, 
which was <a href="https://wg21.link/P0896R4">P0896R4</a>, and which introduced <tt>__cpp_lib_ranges</tt>, on the other hand the specification change affects 
both the <tt>std::ranges</tt> and the <tt>std</tt> forms of <tt>destroy_at</tt>, so it seems plausible to suggest a new, specific feature 
macro for both <tt>destroy_at</tt> function templates. This is what the proposed wording does.
<p/>
LWG should clarify whether an entry to C.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/diff.cpp20">[diff.cpp20]</a> should be added as well.

<p>
Currently integer-class types are required to be wider than every integer type 
(25.3.4.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.concept.winc">[iterator.concept.winc]</a>/3). As a result, if compiler provides extended integer types 
later whose width are not less than that of an integer-class type, then integer-class types with 
that width must be abandoned, which seems ABI-breaking (see also LWG <a href="3828">3828</a>).
<p/>
I think we should allow some extended integer types to be wider than some integer-class types.
</p>

<p><i>[2023-03-22; Reflector poll]</i></p>

<p>
Set priority to 3 after reflector poll.
"Proposed resolution is insufficient. A lot of the wording depends on the fact
that the range of widths of integer-class types and that of integer types are
disjoint. And it also disallows signed integer -> unsigned integer-class
conversion and by extension mixed ops, which is seriously breaking (e.g., it
disallows <code>x += 1</code>)."

<p>
Currently the <tt>value_type</tt> of <tt>std::expected</tt> can be a <i>cv</i>-qualified type, which is  possibly intented. 
However, LWG <a href="3870">3870</a> disallows <tt>std::construct_at</tt> to construct objects via <tt><i>cv</i> T*</tt>, which 
breaks <tt>std::expected&lt;<i>cv</i> T, E&gt;</tt> because some operations are specified with <tt>std::construct_at</tt> 
(22.8.6.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/expected.object.assign">[expected.object.assign]</a>, 22.8.6.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/expected.object.swap">[expected.object.swap]</a>).
<p/>
I think when <tt>T</tt> is <i>cv</i>-qualified, it would be better to store <tt>std::remove_cv_t&lt;T&gt;</tt> subobject 
while sometimes (other than construction/destruction) access it via a <i>cv</i>-qualified glvalue, which can also avoid UB 
associated with <tt>const</tt>/<tt>volatile</tt> objects.
</p>

<p><i>[2023-03-22; Reflector poll]</i></p>

"Not clear if all these wording changes are needed or desired."
"Unconvinced that the mixed-value-error swap should use <code>value()</code>,
source is destroyed immediately anyway. The else branch should use

<p>
The requirements of <tt>viewable_range</tt> for <tt>view</tt> type is <tt>view&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;T&gt;&gt; &amp;&amp; 
constructible_from&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;T&gt;, T&gt;</tt>, that is, when the decayed type of <tt>T</tt> models <tt>view</tt>, 
it must be constructible from <tt>T</tt>.
</p>
<p>
This part of the constraint corresponds to first bullet of <tt>views::all</tt> (26.7.6.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.all.general">[range.all.general]</a>), 
which returns <tt><i>decay-copy</i>(E)</tt> if the decayed type of <tt>E</tt> models <tt>view</tt>.
</p>
<p>
However, <tt><i>decay-copy</i>(E)</tt> constraints <tt>convertible_to&lt;T, decay_t&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt> which is a 
stronger requirement than <tt>constructible_from</tt>, which is reflected in its rejection of types with explicit 
copy constructors.
</p>
<p>
This inconsistency is such that the following causes the range adapter to produce a hard error when invoked 
(<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/PxWfs1Yco">online example</a>):

This requirement introduces a kind of undefined behavior and permits implementation divergence. Currently 
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/16bb556afe5c56fe70a5508a6116842c226dd3be/stl/inc/barrier#L72-L77">MSVC STL</a>

don't.
<p/>
If implementation divergence is not intended, I don't think it makes much sense to introduce UB in this way. 
I guess we should either strengthen the requirement to require well-formedness affection or relax it.

Consider:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
std::generator&lt;int&gt; f();
std::generator&lt;int&gt; g() {
    auto gen = f();
    auto gen2 = f();
    co_yield std::ranges::elements_of(std::move(gen));   // #1
    co_yield std::ranges::elements_of(gen2);             // #2
    // other stuff
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Both #1 and #2 compile. The differences are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
#2 is significantly less efficient (it uses the general overload of <tt>yield_value</tt>,
so it creates a new coroutine frame and doesn't do symmetric transfer into <tt>gen2</tt>'s coroutine)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
the coroutine frame of <tt>gen</tt> and <tt>gen2</tt> are destroyed at different
times: <tt>gen</tt>'s frame is destroyed at the end of #1, but <tt>gen2</tt>'s is
not destroyed until the closing brace.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
But as far as the user is concerned, neither <tt>gen</tt> nor <tt>gen2</tt> is
usable after the <tt>co_yield</tt>. In both cases the only things you can do
with the objects are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>destroying them;</p></li>
<li><p>assigning to them;</p></li>
<li><p>call <tt>end()</tt> on them to get a copy of <tt>default_sentinel</tt>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
We could make #2 ill-formed, but that seems unnecessary: there is no meaningful
difference between <tt>generator</tt> and any other single-pass input range
(or a <tt>generator</tt> with a different yielded type that has to go through
the general overload) in this regard. We should just make #2 do the efficient
thing too.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
When the allocator is not type-erased, the <tt>allocator_arg_t</tt> overloads of
<tt>generator::promise_type::operator new</tt> are constrained on
<tt>convertible_to&lt;const Alloc&amp;, Allocator&gt;</tt>. As a result, if the
the allocator is default-constructible (like <tt>polymorphic_allocator</tt> is)
but the user accidentally provided a wrong type (say, <tt>memory_resource&amp;</tt>
instead of <tt>memory_resource*</tt>), their code will silently fall back to
using a default-constructed allocator. It would seem better to take the tag
as definitive evidence of the user's intent to supply an allocator for the coroutine,
and error out if the supplied allocator cannot be used.
<p/>
This change does mean that the user cannot deliberately pass an incompatible

<p>
Currently libc++ and libstdc++ determine the return type of <tt>std::declval</tt> like this:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class _Tp&gt;
_Tp&amp;&amp; __declval_ret(int); // selected when _Tp is a referenceable type

template&lt;class _Tp&gt;
_Tp __declval_ret(long); // selected when _Tp is cv void

template&lt;class _Tp&gt;
decltype(__declval_ret&lt;_Tp&gt;(0)) declval() noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>
 <p>
This strategy avoids instantiation of class templates. But it also drops <i>cv</i>-qualifiers of the return type 
when the type is <i>cv</i> <tt>void</tt>, which is different from the standard requirements. Such difference has 
no impact in normal use of <tt>std::declval</tt>, but is observable via <tt>decltype(std::declval&lt;const void&gt;)</tt> 
and its friends.
<p/>
Given maintainers may think it's reasonable to keep the current implementation 
(see <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=109049">GCC Bugzilla #109049</a>), 
it may be worthwhile to legitimate such strategy.
<p/>
Should we make such construction ill-formed?

"The testcase isn't even valid with the previous 'conforming' libstdc++ implementation."

This was originally <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/6185">editorial issue #6185</a>.
<p/>
The term "undefined address" is used in 33.5.8.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.types.pointer">[atomics.types.pointer]</a>/8 and 
33.5.7.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.ref.pointer">[atomics.ref.pointer]</a>/6, however, it seems not properly defined and the intended meaning is unclear.
The term originally appeared in the paper <a href="https://wg21.link/N2393">N2393</a> and was reused by <a href="https://wg21.link/P0019R8">P0019R8</a>, but 
no explanation can be found in these papers.
<p/>
Perhaps "undefined address" is related to the undefined behavior specified in 7.6.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/expr.add">[expr.add]</a>.

[For the term SCARY see <a href="https://wg21.link/N2911">N2911</a> and <a href="https://wg21.link/N2913">N2913</a>.]
<p/>
In 26.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.factories">[range.factories]</a> and 26.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.adaptors">[range.adaptors]</a>, many iterator types are specified 
as exposition-only nested classes or nested class templates.
<p/>
This has some observable differences from specifying them as class templates declared in the namespace scope:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>value types are generally not associated entities of iterators or sentinels during ADL, which prevents 
unintended overloads to be found;</p></li>
<li><p>two different range adaptor/factory types, e.g. <tt>iota_view&lt;I, S1&gt;</tt> and <tt>iota_view&lt;I, S2&gt;</tt>, 
have different iterator types.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
The ADL reduction seems preferable. However, is it intended to required to any two different range 
adaptor/factory types to have two different iterator types, even when the same iterator type can work as expected?
<p/>
Sentinel types don't seem able to be SCARY as they are dependent on iterator types.

<p>
"The ADL hiding stuff is a red herring - SCARY-ness doesn't prevent ADL hiding.
Shouldn't require them to be different types (and similarly should not require
const/non-const iterators to be implemented as class templates with a single
bool template parameter)."

LWG <a href="3878">3878</a> specified the effects of importing standard library modules on initialization.

The return type of <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;::operator*</code> is
<code>std::add_lvalue_reference_t&lt;T&gt;</code>,
but there is no mandate stating that <code>*get()</code> is convertible to that type.
There also does not appear to be a mandate that <code>*get()</code> is a valid expression;
dereferenceability is not part of the <i>Cpp17NullablePointer</i> requirements.
A similar issue appears to exist for <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T[]&gt;::operator[]</code>.

However, nothing in 20.2.10 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/default.allocator">[default.allocator]</a> restricts what <tt>T</tt> in <tt>allocator&lt;T&gt;</tt> can be, 
except where 20.2.10.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/allocator.members">[allocator.members]</a>/2 and /6 require it to be complete for <tt>allocate()</tt> and 
<tt>allocate_at_least()</tt> (and by implication, for <tt>deallocate()</tt>). (Long ago, <tt>allocator</tt> had member functions 
whose signatures implied that <tt>const</tt>-qualified types were forbidden, but those signatures were deprecated and 
removed. This explains the phrasing of an MSVC static assertion.)
<p/>
20.4.3.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/mem.poly.allocator.class.general">[mem.poly.allocator.class.general]</a> says a bit more about <tt>Tp</tt> in <tt>polymorphic_allocator&lt;Tp&gt;</tt> 
but doesn't forbid anything. It says that if <tt>Tp</tt> is a <i>cv</i>-unqualified object type, then 
<tt>polymorphic_allocator&lt;Tp&gt;</tt> meets the <i>Cpp17Allocator</i> requirements and allocator completeness requirements, 
but that's all.
<p/>
There's some implementation variation here. libstdc++ and MSVC reject <tt>allocator&lt;const int&gt;</tt>. libc++ 
(as of LLVM 16) accepts it but this appears to have been an extension that they're trying to get rid of (their maintainers 
may be able to comment further; see 
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/a54d028895c91da356a4aaf30e27a5a5b90dd313">llvm-project/commit/a54d028895c91da356a4aaf30e27a5a5b90dd313</a>).
These 3 implementations all reject <tt>allocator&lt;volatile int&gt;</tt>, <tt>polymorphic_allocator&lt;const int&gt;</tt>, 
and <tt>polymorphic_allocator&lt;volatile int&gt;</tt> with varying messages.
<p/>
The Standard should provide clarity here, by mandating that only <i>cv</i>-unqualified object types be given to <tt>allocator</tt>, 
<tt>polymorphic_allocator</tt>, and containers. (<tt>allocator&lt;void&gt;</tt> must also be allowed, of course. I forget 
if <tt>polymorphic_allocator</tt> is supposed to accept <tt>void</tt>.) This would simply Standardize existing/desired practice. 
While it may seem arcane, attempting to form <tt>vector&lt;const T&gt;</tt> is a common novice mistake &mdash; so common that 
MSVC had to add a <tt>static_assert</tt> to emit a clear error message.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Before <a href="https://wg21.link/P0174">P0174</a> had been approved for the working paper, the validity of using <tt>void</tt> as template argument for
<tt>std::allocator</tt> was obvious due to the existing specification of the explicit specialization <tt>allocator&lt;void&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
This specialization was first moved to Annex D ([depr.default.allocator]) and later completely eradicated from the working paper via
adoption of <a href="https://wg21.link/P0619">P0619</a>.
<p/>
The problem is that, since then, we have no explicit wording for <tt>std::allocator</tt> to support <tt>void</tt> as template argument 
any more. We fall now under the constraints for template "components" specified in 16.4.5.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/res.on.functions">[res.on.functions]</a> bullet 2.5.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
-2- In particular, the behavior is undefined in the following cases:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: none">
<li><p>[&hellip;]</p></li>
<li><p>(2.5) &mdash; If an incomplete type (6.8.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/basic.types.general">[basic.types.general]</a>) is used as a template argument when instantiating a 
template component or evaluating a concept, unless specifically allowed for that component.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
But no such allowance wording exists for <tt>allocator&lt;void&gt;</tt> nor for <tt>polymorphic_allocator&lt;void&gt;</tt>, more
to the contrary, 16.4.4.6.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/allocator.requirements.general">[allocator.requirements.general]</a> only refers to <i>cv</i>-unqualified object types as value types
and <tt>void</tt> is not an object type.
<p/>
Now we could argue that the wording is clear that instantiations of these are invalid, but there exists at least some indication
that the instantiations are intended to be allowed.
<p/>
As of 26.8.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/coro.generator.promise">[coro.generator.promise]</a> bullet (17.3) the static <tt>operator new</tt> members of <tt>std::generator</tt>
mention a fall-back of using <tt>allocator&lt;void&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
20.2.10.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/default.allocator.general">[default.allocator.general]</a> says that all specializations of the default allocator meet the allocator completeness 
requirements (16.4.4.6.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/allocator.requirements.completeness">[allocator.requirements.completeness]</a>), but albeit this specification does not specifically exclude 
the existence of an incomplete value type, the wording here does also not provide a definite statement, that it is valid (The 
wording originally was provided when we started adding support for (yet) incomplete value types that at some point later will become
complete, but <tt>void</tt> can never be completed), since it is mostly focused on the completeness requirement for the allocator
type itself.
<p/>
The situation is similar (albeit maybe not that strong) for <tt>polymorphic_allocator&lt;void&gt;</tt>, since
20.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/mem.poly.allocator.class">[mem.poly.allocator.class]</a> p1 has some unusual wording form that says
</p>
<blockquote><p>
-1- A specialization of class template <tt>pmr::polymorphic_allocator</tt> meets the <i>Cpp17Allocator</i> requirements
(16.4.4.6.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/allocator.requirements.general">[allocator.requirements.general]</a>) if its template argument is a <i>cv</i>-unqualified object type.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
and says then in p2:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
-2- A specialization of class template <tt>pmr::polymorphic_allocator</tt> meets the allocator completeness requirements
(16.4.4.6.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/allocator.requirements.completeness">[allocator.requirements.completeness]</a>) if its template argument is a <i>cv</i>-unqualified object type.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Again, this wording is not conclusive, whether <tt>void</tt> is intended to be supported, it is certainly not completely ruled
out, but that is not strong enough to counterpart 16.4.5.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/res.on.functions">[res.on.functions]</a> (2.5). It is maybe worth pointing out that
for a while we were considering to use <tt>void</tt> as default template argument for <tt>pmr::polymorphic_allocator</tt>,
see e.g. <a href="https://wg21.link/P0339R0">P0339R0</a>, but that thought was later replaced by deciding for <tt>std::byte</tt> instead, which
is a complete object type.
<p/>
I assume that at least the intention exists that <tt>std::allocator</tt> is intended to support incomplete types, maybe also
for <tt>polymorphic_allocator</tt>. If <tt>polymorphic_allocator</tt> is intended to support incomplete types as well,
we should also amend 20.4.3.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/mem.poly.allocator.mem">[mem.poly.allocator.mem]</a> p1 and p8 with a <i>Mandates:</i> element similarly as we did

<p>
For a sized common range, <tt>enumerate_view::end()</tt> is specified to call
<tt>ranges::distance</tt>. But <tt>ranges::distance</tt> is not necessarily well-defined
for a sized non-forward range after calling <tt>ranges::begin</tt> (according to
26.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.sized">[range.sized]</a>).
<p/>
So for a sized common non-forward underlying range, it seems calling
<tt>enumerate_view::begin()</tt> followed by <tt>enumerate_view::end()</tt> may invoke UB
and thus make <tt>enumerate_view</tt> potentially unusable for such ranges.
<p/>
I suppose we might need to instead call and cache the result of
<tt>ranges::distance</tt> from <tt>enumerate_view::begin()</tt> for such ranges.

16.4.5.3.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/extern.names">[extern.names]</a> p1 and p2 reserve certain names with external linkage to the implementation.
<p/>
Each paragraph has a footnote, stating that such names include <tt>errno</tt>, <tt>setjmp(jmpbuf)</tt>, and 
<tt>va_end(va_list)</tt>. These names are all defines as macros, not entities with that name and external linkage.
<p/>
Are these footnotes intended by a normative extension to the list of reserved names with external linkage?  
If so, they should be promoted to the main text, as they are no longer a note.
<p/>
If they intend to serve as examples, it is not clear to me what principle is being shown, as there are many 
other macros that might be in a similar position, and I do not see how to follow the a principle that is being 
noted, and presumably follows from the normative text.
<p/>
I <em>think</em> this is intended to be a normative extension to the set of reserved names with external linkage, 
is limited to exactly those three named macros, so should be promoted as a non-note into the main text, but want 
to hear what LWG consensus is before drafting wording.

<p>
Currently none of MSVC STL, libc++, and libstdc++ correctly formats 
<tt>duration&lt;int64_t, ratio&lt;INT64_MAX -1, INT64_MAX&gt;&gt;{40}</tt> 
(<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/GfaEsqMnz">Godbolt link</a>). For MSVC and libstdc++, 
<tt>hh_mm_ss</tt> is used when formatting <tt>duration</tt> and thus <tt>duration_cast</tt> 
is also involved. And it's extremely easy for <tt>duration_cast</tt> to cause UB when the 
source type is <tt>duration&lt;int64_t, ratio&lt;INT64_MAX -1, INT64_MAX&gt;&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
However, 29.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.format">[time.format]</a> doesn't say <tt>hh_mm_ss</tt> is equivalently used when 
formatting duration. And it seems that the current wording require <tt>duration</tt> (whose 
<tt>rep</tt> type is an arithmetic type) to be correctly formatted without UB, even if it is 
of a weird type or extremely large (e.g. when it is 
<tt>duration&lt;int64_t, ratio&lt;INT64_MAX, 1&gt;&gt;{INT64_MAX}</tt>).
<p/>
So, if it is intended that <tt>hh_mm_ss</tt> is used for formatting <tt>duration</tt>, 
perhaps we should explicitly so specify in 29.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.format">[time.format]</a>. And we may need to 
fix initialization of <tt>hh_mm_ss</tt> to reduce UB whenever suitable.

16.4.5.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/namespace.std">[namespace.std]</a>/p2 notes that "unless explicitly prohibited", a user may conditionally specialize 
any class template for program-defined types. 17.3.5.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/numeric.limits.general">[numeric.limits.general]</a>/p1 doesn't explicitly prohibit 
this, but it does create a bit of a grey area with its wording because it describes <tt>numeric_limits</tt> as a 
class template describing "the implementation's representation" of "the arithmetic types".
<p/>
Since this type is about what the implementation provides, and about arithmetic types only, it's not clear whether 
a user can specialize it for their own library type such as <tt>ns::int256</tt>. <tt>ns::int256</tt> isn't an 
arithmetic type (despite resembling one), so one can interpret 16.4.5.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/namespace.std">[namespace.std]</a>/p2's (b) condition to 
mean that <tt>numeric_limits&lt;ns::int256&gt;</tt> needs to be explicitly specialized as if it were the primary 
template.

<p>
The wording of 17.3.5.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/numeric.limits.general">[numeric.limits.general]</a> seemingly has not been gone through a similar thorough 
rewording review which we performed in the past to clean-up the working draft as we did via the series of 
"Mandating" papers by Marshall Clow (<a href="https://wg21.link/P1458">P1458</a> - <a href="https://wg21.link/P1465">P1465</a> and even more).
<p/>
17.3.5.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/numeric.limits.general">[numeric.limits.general]</a> contains several nowadays inappropriate wording forms, which don't 
distinguish well enough between requirements imposed on implementations (Where we shouldn't use "shall" wording 
in the ambiguous form of "Specializations shall be provided for each arithmetic type") and requirements imposed on
user types, this has also caused confusion as expressed in LWG <a href="3922">3922</a>. It is "obvious"
that a program is intended to be allowed to provide program-defined specializations, but as 
LWG <a href="3922">3922</a> points out, it is unclear how such a specialization is able to meet the requirement 
"(b) the specialization meets the standard library requirements for the original template" specified in 
16.4.5.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/namespace.std">[namespace.std]</a> p2.
<p/>
Another problem is the usage of the unclear wording "Non-arithmetic standard types", which should be replaced by
a more precise wording form.
<p/>
An additional problem is that we actually already <em>do</em> require an implementation to provide specializations
for the (library-provided) integer-class types (25.3.4.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.concept.winc">[iterator.concept.winc]</a>), so contrary to what p6
says, we already have at least one exception, where the library is required to specialize <tt>numeric_limits</tt>
for a non-arithmetic type. We should make that a bit clearer here as well.
<p/>
This issue is related to LWG <a href="3922">3922</a> and paper <a href="https://wg21.link/P1841">P1841</a>.

</blockquote>
<p>
This could be read as saying that if you have a program that doesn't contain data races, 
and you change it by adding a call to any of these three functions, such a change does not 
"introduce" data races into the program. In other words, it could be read as saying that 
these three functions don't race with any other member functions on the same 
<tt>stop_token</tt> or <tt>stop_source</tt> object.
<p/>
I'm guessing the actual intended meaning is that calls to these three functions do not race
with each other, because it would be more expensive if concurrent calls with 
<tt>stop_token::operator=</tt> were also required to not race. (Also, none of these functions 
can avoid racing with the destructor.)

"preconditions" refer to runtime requirements, not compile-time.  As such, the
column labeled "preconditions" in Table 47: Type property predicates [tab:meta.unary.prop]
would be better labeled as "Mandates".
<p/>
This is an LWG issue and not editorial, and "Mandates" would require the library
to diagnose violations, but after reviewing all traits in this table, I believe that is
reasonable.
<p/>
Table 48: Type property queries [tab:meta.unary.prop.query] shows how <i>Mandates:</i>
elements can be integrated into the "Value" column if we preferred that approach, but for the
number of entries in the first table seems like an aggressive change for consistency.
<p/>
Similarly, for Table 49: Type relationship predicates [tab:meta.rel] the "Comments"
column serves as a "Mandates" feature without using that term, so I suggest changing
that column title too.
<p/>
The other tables and type traits wording already appear to be adapted to the Mandates
wording style.

<p>
Currently, comparison CPOs may call ADL-found <tt>strong_order</tt>, <tt>weak_order</tt>, and <tt>partial_order</tt> 
functions. It might be impossible to meet the expression-equivalent requirement if one passed argument is a prvalue 
and an ADL-found function is selected, because temporary materialization must take place before entering the CPO's 
<tt>operator()</tt>.
<p/>
Perhaps we should say when <tt>E</tt> or <tt>F</tt> is a prvalue expression of an object type, temporary 
materialization takes place first, and then an xvalue referring to the temporary object is used instead of the original 
<tt>E</tt> or <tt>F</tt>.
<p/>
There is currently implementation divergence in these CPOs: when performing internal comparison, libstdc++ and libc++ 
perfect-forward arguments, while MSVC STL always treats arguments as lvalues.

<h3><a name="3933" href="3933">3933.</a> P1467R9 accidentally changed the signatures of certain constructors of <tt>std::complex</tt></h3>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In C++20 and earlier revisions, there are constructors taking two floating-point numbers by value in explicit 
specializations of <tt>std::complex</tt> for standard floating-point types. Since <a href="https://wg21.link/P1467R9">P1467R9</a> has 
removed these explicit specializations, the corresponding constructor in the primary template that takes arguments 
by <tt>const T&amp;</tt> are used instead. As a result, the following program becomes ill-formed after the changes.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;complex&gt;

int main()
{
  volatile double x = 0.0;
  std::complex&lt;double&gt; z{x, x}; // <span  style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bold">ill-formed due to P1467R9 because const double&amp; cannot be bound to a volatile double lvalue</span>
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Currently, libstdc++ has implemented complex specializations for extended floating-point types, but the corresponding 
constructors of these specializations takes two arguments by value, which is consistent with old specializations.
<p/>
It seems that it's unintended to change the signatures of these constructors. Perhaps we should restore the signatures for 
required specializations.
</p>

<p>
<b>Daniel:</b>
<p/>
Not only constructors are affected, but also all assignment operators taking the <tt>value_type</tt> as
parameter and I suggest that LEWG should have a look at this issue.
</p>

<p><i>[2023-05-20; Daniel comments and suggests wording]</i></p>

<p>
The wording below attempts to restore the exact previous behaviour: For all floating-point types the 
function parameter types are "by value" and for other types are "by const reference". The wording adds for 
specification purposes a dependency to the concept <tt>std::floating_point</tt>, but that doesn't mean that an 
implementation couldn't realize the required effects without usage of concepts or the <tt>&lt;type_traits&gt;</tt>
header.
<p/>
Note that we have already precedence for similar cases where we later reintroduced concept requirements to library
parts where no concept dependencies had exist before, such as the <tt>iterator_traits</tt> specialization for
pointers (to object) or the additional constraints of <tt>set</tt>'s member function 
<tt>iterator erase(const_iterator position)</tt> or the constraint for <tt>reverse_iterator::operator-&gt;()</tt>,
just to name a few.
<p/>
One alternative approach could be to switch to "by-value" signatures only for the affected signatures. This could 
affect user-defined floating-point-like types such as those with an arbitrary precision, therefore I started with 
the most conservative approach restoring the original effects that was present in the
working draft <a href="https://wg21.link/N4910">N4910</a> and older ones. It might we worth pointing out that the existing "setter"
functions <tt>imag</tt> and <tt>real</tt> have always been using "by-value" signatures for all specializations.
<p/>
There exists also the possible argument to close this issue as NAD based on the argument that all existing 
non-member operators taking a <tt>value_type</tt> argument had always been defined to use <tt>const T&amp;</tt>
as parameter (such as the <tt>operator@(const T&amp; lhs, const complex&lt;T&gt;&amp; rhs)</tt> forms).
<p/>
My main argument to solve this issue as shown below is based on the ground that the refactoring done by
<a href="https://wg21.link/P1467R9">P1467R9</a> was mainly inspired to simplify the existing wording and to make it more easy to
integrate the addition of the extended floating-point types here, as quoted from 
<a href="https://wg21.link/p1467r9#complex">P1467R9 section 6.6. <tt>&lt;complex&gt;</tt></a>:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
[&hellip;] The explicit specializations of <tt>std::complex&lt;T&gt;</tt> are removed. The only differences between 
the explicit specializations was the explicit-ness of the constructors that take a complex number of a different type. 
</blockquote>
<p>
This issue has some overlap with LWG <a href="3934">3934</a>, which suggests a yet missing specification for
the assignment operator taking the <tt>value_type</tt> as parameter.
</p>

<p><i>[2023-06-01; Reflector poll]</i></p>

<p>
Set priority to 4 after reflector poll.
</p>
<p>
Several votes for NAD, as this only affects <code>volatile</code> arguments,
so this might even be an accidental improvement.

<p>
The class template <tt>complex</tt> synopsis in 28.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/complex">[complex]</a> shows the following member function:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
constexpr complex&amp; operator= (const T&amp;);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
but does not specify its semantics. This affects a code example such as the following one:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;complex&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
  std::complex&lt;double&gt; z(1, 1);
  z = 2;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; z &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This problem exists since the 1998 version of the standard (at that time this was declared in subclause [lib.complex]),
but fortunately the three major implementations all behave consistently by assigning the provided value to the real
part and nullifying the imaginary part, causing the output <tt>(2, 0)</tt>, which is consistent with the expected
behaviour of usual mathematical convention and that of C's built-in <tt>complex</tt> types. We should specify this.
<p/>
The lack of this member specification was observed while a proposed wording for LWG <a href="3933">3933</a> was prepared.

<p>
This needs to work for any object with a public and unambiguous base class
of type <code>basic_ostream&lt;charT, traits&gt;</code>, not only objects
of exactly that type.
</p>
<p>
In C++98 and C++03, <code>setfill</code> did actually get this right
("if <code>out</code> is (or is derived from)
<code>basic_ostream&lt;charT,traits&gt;</code>"),
but that was "fixed" for C++11 to be consistent with the other manipulators.
</p>
<p>
31.7.9 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/quoted.manip">[quoted.manip]</a> is slightly different, talking about
"an instance of <code>basic_ostream</code>", but that's not right either.

22.14.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/format.string.std">[format.string.std]</a> p21 says:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
The available integer presentation types for integral types other than <tt>bool</tt> and <tt>charT</tt> are 
specified in Table 68.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When <tt>charT</tt> is <tt>wchar_t</tt>, the ordinary character type <tt>char</tt> falls into this category, and thus a 
<tt>char</tt> gets formatted as an integer by default, not as a character.
<p/>
This arguably doesn't affect the <tt>std::format</tt> family, because they are specified in terms of <tt>make_format_args</tt>, 
which calls the <tt>basic_format_arg</tt> constructor, which converts <tt>char</tt> to <tt>wchar_t</tt> 
(22.14.8.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/format.arg">[format.arg]</a> (6.2)). But it does affect the <tt>std::formatter&lt;char, wchar_t&gt;</tt> specialization, 
which isn't specified to use <tt>basic_format_arg</tt>.
<p/>
This is especially problematic after <a href="https://wg21.link/P2286R8">P2286R8</a>, which makes <tt>std::formatter&lt;char, wchar_t&gt;</tt> 
debug-enabled, but there's no debug format for integral types other than <tt>charT</tt>.
<p/>
Perhaps [format.string.std] should say that the formatting arguments are converted as if through the <tt>basic_format_arg</tt> 
constructor.
<p/>
At the time of writing, on libstdc++ and libc++, <tt>std::formatter&lt;char, wchar_t&gt;</tt> formats the argument as 
a character when no specifier is given (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/nnsEcvna3">godbolt.org/z/nnsEcvna3</a>), while 
MSVC STL's <tt>std::formatter&lt;char, wchar_t&gt;</tt> outputs the integer value. But I'm about to change MSVC STL to 
match the other implementations.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
[Discovered by Ori Lahav, lead author of <a href="https://plv.mpi-sws.org/scfix/paper.pdf">Repairing Sequential Consistency in C/C++11</a>,
which <a href="https://wg21.link/P0668">P0668</a> more or less tried to implement. This description also includes observations 
from Olivier Giroux and David Goldblatt.]
<p/>
Currently, we require that the sequential consistency order S is consistent with the extended coherence order, 
which includes "reads before" and "reads from". This may require sc reads to be consistently ordered 
even if they see non-sc writes. This is not enforced by some "fence-after-store"/"trailing fence" sc 
implementations, notably on X86. It may also be violated by compiler transformations that eliminate a 
sequentially consistent load after a store into the same location, e.g. on sequentially consistent hardware.
<p/>
As Ori pointed out, this is exhibited by their (SB + rfis) example on x86 reproduced below. I would expect 
this also happens on other platforms. The (SB + rfis) example:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Thread 1: x.store(1, mo_release); r1 = x.load() /* sees 1 */; r2 = y.load() /* sees 0 */
Thread 2: y.store(1, mo_release); r1 = y.load() /* sees 1 */; r2 = x.load() /* sees 0 */
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is unintentionally and unexpectedly disallowed by the current standard. We can see this as follows:
<p/>
We have the following coherence-ordered-before relationships:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: none">
<li><p>By 3.1 in 33.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> (reads-from): The store in each thread is coherence-ordered-before the 
immediately following load.</p></li>
<li><p>By 3.3 (reads-before): The final load in each thread is coherence-ordered before the store in the other thread.</p></li>
<li><p>By 3.4 (transitivity): The final load in each thread is coherence-ordered-before the initial load in the other thread.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
On the other hand, the initial load in each thread is sequenced-before and thus strongly-happens-before 
6.9.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.races">[intro.races]</a> p12.1 the final load in that thread. Thus coherence-ordered-before union strongly-happens-before 
is cyclic. But the S relation 33.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p4 must order all the loads, consistent with both strongly-happens-before 
(p4) and coherence-ordered-before (p4.1), which is clearly impossible.
<p/>
With the standard x86 implementation, no fences are inserted. Thread 1 and Thread 2 see the stores to <tt>x</tt> and 
<tt>y</tt> in inconsistent orders, which is allowed by TSO, since each thread can see its own write early. Thus the 
implementation allows the outcome in question, as expected.
<p/>
The problem here is an error during the attempt to simplify and translate 
<a href="https://plv.mpi-sws.org/scfix/paper.pdf">plv.mpi-sws.org/scfix/paper.pdf</a> to standardese. There is no known 
issue with the underlying paper.
<p/>
I have not yet wrapped my head around this sufficiently to be able to suggest a solution, or to understand how difficult 
that will be. This happened as a consequence of attempting to strengthen SC fences, and <em>not</em> fixing the Power 
compilation problem (<a href="https://wg21.link/P0668">P0668</a>). So we could probably improve matters by reverting the strengthening of sc fences. 
Clearly, we'd prefer to avoid that. We could just adopt the formulation in the paper, though that seems even harder to motivate 
informally. Fundamentally, it feels like we inadvertently strengthened (and broke) the semantics of ordinary sc operations, 
when we intended to only affect fences. The original paper makes more of a distinction there. The question is how we can 
reformulate that suitably here.
<p/>
[ Meta-observation from a small off-line discussion that may be relevant to how we phrase the resolution here: The fact that 
nobody noticed this for a very long time, and implementers were not bothered by it, suggests that the audience for this part 
of the standard is nearly empty. We conjecture that implementers actually rely on atomics mappings generated by memory model 
experts, who are more interested in formal models than standardese. A more formal description is likely to increase the size 
of the audience, and would definitely ease verification and reduce the probability of mistakes like this.]

<p>
In the standard specializations of <tt>std::char_traits</tt> (<tt>std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;</tt> etc.), there 
are a few member functions take a single character via a <tt>const char_type&amp;</tt> parameter, while other functions 
take a single character by value.
<p/>
In C++98, there were more functions taking <tt>const char_type&amp;</tt>. <a href="https://wg21.link/N2349">N2349</a> changed this in 
C++11 by making some, but not all of them take <tt>char_type</tt>. It is unclear whether the inconsistency is 
intended, and it seems better for these standard specializations to take a character by value.
<p/>
However, libstdc++ hasn't implemented the signature changes, perhaps due to ABI concerns. So it might be better 
to loose the restrictions for the purpose of standardization.

<p>
A <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/62074">bug</a> has been
filed against libc++'s format implementation. The question arose whether
the parsed <i>chrono-specs</i> should still be available during executing the
formatter's <tt>format</tt> member function. Libc++'s implementation requires
this MSVC STL's implementation does not.
<p/>
It turns out there is a lifetime a requirement in the Standard, but it
would be good to clarify the intention of the wording. Prosed a small
wording improvement and a note to clarify the intention.
<p/>
Currently the <tt>format</tt> function may use elements in the range <tt>[pc.begin(),
pc.end())</tt> that have not been parsed. This does not seem to be in the
spirit of the formatting library. The wording change proposes to
restrict this range to the parsed range.
</p>

The proposed resolution is missing a guarantee that the parsed portion of the

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
I noticed some interesting features introduced by the range based
formatters in C++23
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
// Ill-formed in C++20 and C++23
const char* cstr = "hello";
char* str = const_cast&lt;char*&gt;(cstr);
std::format(L"{}", str);
std::format(L"{}",cstr);

// Ill-formed in C++20
// In C++23 they give L"['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']"
std::format(L"{}", "hello"); // A libc++ bug prevents this from working.
std::format(L"{}", std::string_view("hello"));
std::format(L"{}", std::string("hello"));
std::format(L"{}", std::vector{'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'});
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
An example is shown <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/P9E6TK3YW">here</a>. This only
shows libc++ since libstdc++ and MSVC STL have not implemented the
formatting ranges papers (<a href="https://wg21.link/P2286R8">P2286R8</a> and <a href="https://wg21.link/P2585R0">P2585R0</a>) yet.
<p/>
The difference between C++20 and C++23 is the existence of range
formatters. These formatters use the formatter specialization
<tt>formatter&lt;char, wchar_t&gt;</tt> which converts the sequence of <tt>char</tt>s 
to a sequence of <tt>wchar_t</tt>s.
<p/>
In this conversion <tt>same_as&lt;char, charT&gt;</tt> is <tt>false</tt>, thus the requirements
of the range-type <tt>s</tt> and <tt>?s</tt> ([tab:formatter.range.type]) aren't met. So
the following is ill-formed:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::format(L"{:s}", std::string("hello")); // Not L"hello"
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
It is surprising that some string types can be formatted as a sequence
of wide-characters, but others not. A sequence of characters can be a
sequence UTF-8 code units. This is explicitly supported in the width
estimation of string types. The conversion of <tt>char</tt> to <tt>wchar_t</tt> will
convert the individual code units, which will give incorrect results for
multi-byte code points. It will not transcode UTF-8 to UTF-16/32. The
current behavior is not in line with the note in
22.14.6.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/format.formatter.spec">[format.formatter.spec]</a>/2
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[<i>Note 1</i>: Specializations such as <tt>formatter&lt;wchar_t, char&gt;</tt> and
<tt>formatter&lt;const char*, wchar_t&gt;</tt> that would require implicit
multibyte / wide string or character conversion are disabled. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Disabling this could be done by explicitly disabling the <tt>char</tt> to <tt>wchar_t</tt>
sequence formatter. Something along the lines of
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;ranges::input_range R&gt;
  requires(format_kind&lt;R&gt; == range_format::sequence &amp;&amp;
           same_as&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;ranges::range_reference_t&lt;R&gt;&gt;, char&gt;)
struct formatter&lt;R, wchar_t&gt; : __disabled_formatter {};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
where <tt>__disabled_formatter</tt> satisfies 22.14.6.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/format.formatter.spec">[format.formatter.spec]</a>/5, would
do the trick. This disables the conversion for all sequences not only
the string types. So <tt>vector</tt>, <tt>array</tt>, <tt>span</tt>, etc. would be disabled.
<p/>
This does not disable the conversion in the <tt>range_formatter</tt>. This allows
users to explicitly opt in to this formatter for their own
specializations.
<p/>
An alternative would be to only disable this conversion for string type
specializations (22.14.6.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/format.formatter.spec">[format.formatter.spec]</a>/2.2) where <tt>char</tt> to 
<tt>wchar_t</tt> is used:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;size_t N&gt; struct formatter&lt;charT[N], charT&gt;;
template&lt;class traits, class Allocator&gt;
  struct formatter&lt;basic_string&lt;charT, traits, Allocator&gt;, charT&gt;;
template&lt;class traits&gt;
  struct formatter&lt;basic_string_view&lt;charT, traits&gt;, charT&gt;;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Disabling following the following two is not strictly required:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;&gt; struct formatter&lt;char*, wchar_t&gt;;
template&lt;&gt; struct formatter&lt;const char*, wchar_t&gt;;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
However, if (<tt>const</tt>) <tt>char*</tt> becomes an <tt>input_range</tt> 
in a future version C++, these formatters would become enabled. 
Disabling all five instead of the three required specializations seems like a 
future proof solution.
<p/>
Since there is no enabled narrowing formatter specialization
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;&gt; struct formatter&lt;wchar_t, char&gt;;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
there are no issues for <tt>wchar_t</tt> to <tt>char</tt> conversions.
<p/>
Before proceeding with a proposed resolution the following design
questions need to be addressed:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do we want to allow string types of <tt>char</tt>s to be formatted as
sequences of <tt>wchar_t</tt>s?</p></li>
<li><p>Do we want to allow non string type sequences of <tt>char</tt>s to be
formatted as sequences of <tt>wchar_t</tt>s?</p></li>
<li><p>Should we disable <tt>char</tt> to <tt>wchar_t</tt> conversion in the <tt>range_formatter</tt>?</p></li>
</ul>

The <tt>&lt;string_view&gt;</tt> synopsis in 23.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/string.view.synop">[string.view.synop]</a> has these signatures
for <tt>operator==</tt> and <tt>operator&lt;=&gt;</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
// <i>23.3.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/string.view.comparison">[string.view.comparison]</a>, non-member comparison functions</i>
template&lt;class charT, class traits&gt;

template&lt;class charT, class traits&gt;
  constexpr see below operator&lt;=&gt;(basic_string_view&lt;charT, traits&gt; x,

// <i>see 23.3.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/string.view.comparison">[string.view.comparison]</a>, sufficient additional overloads of comparison functions</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In 23.3.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/string.view.comparison">[string.view.comparison]</a>, paragraph 1 states that "Implementations
shall provide sufficient additional overloads" so that all comparisons
between a <tt>basic_string_view&lt;C, T&gt;</tt> object and an object of a type
convertible to <tt>basic_string_view&lt;C, T&gt;</tt> work (with the reasonable
semantics).
<p/>
The associated Example 1 proposes this implementation strategy for
<tt>operator==</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class charT, class traits&gt;
  constexpr bool operator==(basic_string_view&lt;charT, traits&gt; lhs,
                            basic_string_view&lt;charT, traits&gt; rhs) noexcept {
    return lhs.compare(rhs) == 0;
  }
template&lt;class charT, class traits&gt;
  constexpr bool operator==(basic_string_view&lt;charT, traits&gt; lhs,
                            type_identity_t&lt;basic_string_view&lt;charT, traits&gt;&gt; rhs) noexcept {
    return lhs.compare(rhs) == 0;
  }
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
With the current semantics of rewritten candidates for the comparison
operators, it is however superfluous to actually specify both overloads
(the same applies for <tt>operator&lt;=&gt;</tt>).
<p/>
The second overload (using <tt>type_identity_t</tt>) is indeed necessary to
implement the "sufficient additional overloads" part of 23.3.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/string.view.comparison">[string.view.comparison]</a>, 
but it is also sufficient, as all the following cases
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><tt>sv == sv</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>sv == <i>convertible_to_sv</i></tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt><i>convertible_to_sv</i> == sv</tt></p></li>
</ul>
<p>
can in fact use it (directly, or after being rewritten e.g. with the
arguments swapped).
<p/>
The reason why we still do have both operators seems to be historical;
there is an explanation offered <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/70851101">here</a> by Barry Revzin.
<p/>
Basically, there were three overloads before a bunch of papers regarding
<tt>operator&lt;=&gt;</tt> and <tt>operator==</tt> were merged:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p><tt>operator==(<i>bsv</i>, <i>bsv</i>)</tt> to deal with <tt>sv == sv</tt>;</p></li>
<li><p><tt>operator==(<i>bsv</i>, type_identity_t&lt;<i>bsv</i>&gt;)</tt> and</p></li>
<li><p><tt>operator==(type_identity_t&lt;<i>bsv</i>&gt;, <i>bsv</i>)</tt> to deal with 
<tt>sv == <i>convertible_to_sv</i></tt> and vice versa.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Overload (1) was necessary because with only (2) and (3) a call like 
<tt>sv == sv</tt> would otherwise be ambiguous. With the adoption of the rewriting
rules, overload (3) has been dropped, without realizing that overload
(1) would then become redundant.
<p/>
The specification of these overloads can be greatly simplified by
adjusting the signatures to explicitly use <tt>type_identity_t</tt>.

<p>
The <tt>indirectly_readable</tt> concept (25.3.4.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.concept.readable">[iterator.concept.readable]</a>) requires 
<tt>iter_reference_t&lt;In&gt;&amp;&amp;</tt> and <tt>iter_value_t&lt;In&gt;&amp;</tt> to model 
<tt>common_reference_with</tt>, which ensures that the input iterator always has a common reference type.
<p/>
However, <tt>iter_common_reference_t</tt> for computing such types is defined as
<tt>common_reference_t&lt;iter_reference_t&lt;T&gt;, <i>indirect-value-t</i>&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
It is  unclear why the formula here drop the <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt> part of <tt>iter_reference_t&lt;In&gt;</tt>, 
but theoretically it is not completely equivalent to the former, <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/h6GKn6oss">for example</a>:    
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;iterator&gt;

struct Ref {
  Ref(const Ref&amp;) = delete;
};

struct Val {
  operator const Ref&amp;() const &amp;;
};

struct I {
  using value_type = Val;
  using difference_type = int;
  Ref operator*() const;
  I&amp; operator++();
  I operator++(int);
};

static_assert(std::input_iterator&lt;I&gt;);
using reference  = std::iter_reference_t&lt;I&gt;;
using value_type = std::iter_value_t&lt;I&gt;;
static_assert(std::same_as&lt;std::common_reference_t&lt;reference&amp;&amp;, value_type&amp;&gt;, const Ref&amp;&gt;);
static_assert(std::same_as&lt;std::common_reference_t&lt;reference  , value_type&amp;&gt;,       Ref &gt;);

std::iter_value_t&lt;I&gt; val;
std::iter_common_reference_t&lt;I&gt; cr = val; // <span style="color:red;font-weight:bolder">failed</span>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In the above example, <tt>input_iterator</tt> ensures that the iterator's lvalue value type and rvalue reference type 
can be bound to its common reference type, namely <tt>const Ref&amp;</tt>, but the type calculated by 
<tt>iter_common_reference_t</tt> is <tt>Ref</tt>, which cannot be bound by both.
<p/>
The proposed resolution re-adds the <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt> to <tt>iter_reference_t&lt;In&gt;</tt> in formulas of similar 
form to conform to the definition of <tt>indirectly_readable</tt>.

"NAD - This can easily lead to dangling references. This only matters if
<code>iter_reference_t</code> isn't a language reference type,
and the change causes <code>common_reference</code> to produce
a language reference type. So binding to the common reference requires
a temporary. That's not going to work if the type is used as a return type
(as the const-cases are).
As written I think it also causes significant damage to constant-iterator."

<p>
Several feature-test macros are available in C++ versions of C headers (e.g. <tt>__cpp_lib_byte</tt> is available in 
<tt>&lt;cstddef&gt;</tt>). However, the current standard wording doesn't seem to make the distinction between C++ library 
feature-test macros and macros from C, so it's not very clear that whether <tt>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</tt> and its friends are 
required to provide <tt>__cpp_lib_*</tt> macros in C++.
<p/>
Presumably, <tt><i>name</i>.h</tt> should provide macros shown in the synopsis of its corresponding <tt>c<i>name</i></tt> 
(as required in C), but should not be required to provide C++ library feature-test macros because such requirement would 
generally require implementations of the C standard library to change. I think we should make clarification in 
17.14.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/support.c.headers.general">[support.c.headers.general]</a>.

<p>
Currently, some operations of <tt>std::flat_map</tt> are specified to construct a <tt>key_equiv</tt> 
object for calling <tt>ranges::unique</tt> to remove duplicated elements. It seems that the comparator 
is required to be copied twice before calling <tt>ranges::unique</tt>.
<p/>
If we make <tt>key_equiv</tt> to an aggregate class, then the comparator will be only copied once. 
Furtherly, if we use a <tt>std::reference_wrapper&lt;const key_compare&gt;</tt> as the member of 
<tt>key_equiv</tt>, then we will be able to avoid copying. Such differences seem to be observable.
<p/>
Should we require to avoid copying, or explicitly say that implementations can either make copies or avoid copying?
<p/>
Likewise, <tt>std::flat_map::value_comp</tt> and <tt>std::flat_multimap::value_comp</tt> seem to be 
required to copy the comparator twice due to the exposition-only constructor of <tt>value_compare</tt>. 
<p/>
Should we make the constructor take a <tt>const</tt> reference?

<p>
29.13 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.parse">[time.parse]</a> p16 says:
"If the type being parsed cannot represent the information that the format flag refers to, <tt>is.setstate(ios_base::failbit)</tt> is called."
Note it says "the format flag" singular. I had interpreted this as meaning that if the entire format string doesn't provide the info 
needed by the type, it fails. But that's not what it says.
It says that parsing fails if the type cannot represent
"the information that the format flag refers to". Which format flag?
Presumably this rule applies to each of them in turn.
So <tt>"Monday 13:00" &gt;&gt; parse("%a %R", sec)</tt> is required to fail,
rather than ignore the %a part and set <tt>sec</tt> to <tt>13h</tt>.
I don't think that is the intended design.
I think the phrasing of this rule is backwards. It shouldn't be focused on what info is provided by the format flag, 
but what info is needed by the type.
</p>

<p>
What should happen when <tt>chrono::parse</tt> is given a meaningless
format string like "%", or "%E", or "%Ea" or "%99a"?
Presumably that should set failbit, but I don't think we actually say so.
If the implementation should set failbit, is it conforming to do so before
extracting any characters?
</p>
<p>
Is it conforming to set failbit before extracting any characters if the
format string can never succeed for the parsable type?
Consider:
<pre><blockquote>std::chrono::seconds sec;
std::cin &gt;&gt; parse("%a", sec);
</blockquote></pre>

The type being parsed (<tt>seconds</tt>) cannot represent the information that
%a (a weekday) refers to, so we should set <tt>cin.setstate(ios_base::failbit)</tt>.
But should that happen before extracting any characters, or after extracting
a weekday string? If it's unspecified, should we say so explicitly?
</p>

<p>
Can a conforming implementation validate the format string before extracting
any characters, and fail early if parsing the actual istream contents can never
succeed? Or is <tt>parse("%a", sec)</tt> required to try to parse a valid
weekday name before setting <tt>failbit</tt>?

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
<tt>std::is_nothrow_*</tt> traits are currently specified in the form "(some operation) is known not to throw any exceptions". 
Under the following circumstance, the current specification may be ambiguous:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a trait detects an explicitly defaulted special member function, and</p></li>
<li><p>the implicit except specification of that function would be <tt>noexcept(true)</tt>, but</p></li>
<li><p>the function is explicitly marked with <tt>noexcept(false)</tt>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
It seems that an implementation may decompose the defaulted special member function and then conclude that the trait 
should give a <tt>true</tt> result, or may just use the exception specification which gives a <tt>false</tt> result.
<p/>
Implementors seemingly hold different opinions, see <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=106611">GCC Bug 106611</a> 
and <a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2023/04/17/noexcept-false-equals-default/">this blog post</a>.
<p/> 
Perhaps we may need to clarify that the implementation divergence is permitted, or unambiguously specify these 
traits to give results consistent with exception specifications.

<p>
22.15.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/bit.endian">[bit.endian]</a> says that "big-endian" and "little-endian" refer to whether bytes are stored 
in descending or ascending order of significance. In other words, when <tt>std::endian::native</tt> is either 
<tt>std::endian::big</tt> or <tt>std::endian::little</tt>, we are told something about the object representations o
f multi-byte scalar types. However, the guarantee provided in this case is not strong enough to fully specify 
the object representation, even in the common situation where padding bits are not present. It would be more 
useful to provide a stronger guarantee.
<p/>
Consider, for example, if <tt>char</tt> is 8 bits and there is an <tt>uint32_t</tt> type on the current platform. 
If <tt>std::endian::native</tt> is <tt>std::endian::little</tt>, then the program should be able to rely on the 
fact that if a <tt>uint32_t</tt> object is copied into an array of 4 <tt>unsigned char</tt>, then the value of 
the first element of that array actually equals the original value modulo 256. However, because 
<a href="https://wg21.link/P1236R1">P1236R1</a> removed the core language specification of the value representation of unsigned integer 
types, the program cannot actually rely on this. It is conceivable (though unlikely), for example, that 
<tt>std::endian::native</tt> could be <tt>std::endian::little</tt> but the first byte in a <tt>uint32_t</tt> 
object is actually the least significant 8 bits flipped, or the least significant 8 bits permuted, or something 
like that.

<p>
The issue that <tt>concat_view</tt> implicitly breaks equality-preserving by concatenating range of references with range 
of prvalues seems to be reflected in <tt>join_view</tt> as well.
<p/>
When the reference of the inner range is <tt>string&amp;&amp;</tt> and the reference of the pattern range is prvalue 
<tt>string</tt>, dereferencing its iterator will move the elements of the inner range to the returned <tt>string</tt>, 
which makes the second dereference get an empty <tt>string</tt> (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5YYzK5qsr">demo</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
vector v1{"hello"s};
vector v2{"world"s};
vector v{v1 | views::as_rvalue, v2 | views::as_rvalue};
auto pattern = views::iota(0, 1) | views::transform([](int) { return ", "s; });
ranges::forward_range auto joined = v | views::join_with(pattern);
fmt::print("{}\n", joined); // ["hello", ", ", "world"]
fmt::print("{}\n", joined); // <span style="color:red;font-weight:bolder">["", ", ", ""]</span>
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>iter_swap</tt> customization for <tt>join_with_view::<i>iterator</i></tt> allows swapping iterators 
with different element types, potentially leading to unsafe behavior, <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5qzGb881x">for example</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
vector&lt;vector&lt;string&gt;&gt; x{{"a"}, {"b"}, {"c"}};
vector&lt;string_view&gt;    y{"-"};
auto r = x | views::join_with(y);
auto i = r.begin();
auto j = ranges::next(i);
ranges::iter_swap(j, i);
for (auto&amp;&amp; elem : r)
  cout &lt;&lt; elem &lt;&lt; " "; // <span style="color:red;font-weight:bolder">AddressSanitizer: stack-use-after-return on address</span>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The above swaps two iterators whose reference are <tt>string_view&amp;</tt> and <tt>string&amp;</tt> respectively, 
which ultimately results in <tt>string_view</tt> being referenced to a local variable and left dangling.

<p>
The current wording allows users to specialize <tt>std::basic_format_context</tt>. However, an implementation is not 
likely to accept a program that uses the library in a way that would instantiate such a specialization, because 
22.14.6.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/format.context">[format.context]</a> does not provide a complete description of the interface that such a specialization 
would need to have (e.g., it does not provide a means to initialize the exposition-only <tt>args_</tt> member). Since the 
library was not designed to be able to work with user specializations of <tt>std::basic_format_context</tt>, declaring 
such specializations should be explicitly disallowed.

<p>
During the reflector discussion, Dietmar pointed out that the constraint can in principle be checked statically (e.g. when the 
Library creates or refers to an instantiation of <tt>basic_format_context</tt>), so we can reduce the rather draconian consequence of
"undefined behaviour" to "ill-formed, no diagnostics required". Furthermore, the new wording also adds the same constraint to
<tt>basic_format_parse_context</tt> as suggested by Tim. This is needed, since only one public constructor is specified, but
that specification does not allow to construct an object a non-zero <tt>num_args_</tt> or with the type information necessary 
for the <tt>check_dynamic_spec*</tt> functions, so the library has an unspecified way to realize this.

<p>
Trying to interpret the specification for <i>allocator-aware container</i>s, 24.2.2.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.alloc.reqmts">[container.alloc.reqmts]</a>.
<p/>
P1 establishes that <tt>std::array</tt> is <em>not</em> an allocator-aware container, but all other containers in
the standard are.
<p/>
P2 then adds vocabulary, with ruling that if a container type <tt>X</tt> is not allocator-aware then
the specification is as-if the allocator were <tt>std::allocator&lt;T&gt;</tt>. I cannot find a specification
for allocator-aware, and do not believe we should treat this as a recursive definition, as
the only standard container that would be affected would be <tt>std::array</tt>, which absolutely
does not want to apply all the terms in this subclause.
<p/>
It looks like we might mean types that do not have everything specified by the first
sentence, such as an <tt>allocator_type</tt> member. Perhaps we want to say a container
type <tt>X</tt> is allocator-aware using allocator <tt>A</tt> if [&hellip;], and then that <tt>basic_string</tt> and
containers that are not otherwise allocator aware are are treated as-if they were
allocator-aware using <tt>std::allocator&lt;typename X::value_type&gt;</tt> (where <tt>value_type</tt>
is already guaranteed to exist by the <i>container</i> requirements, 24.2.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.reqmts">[container.reqmts]</a> p1).

<p>
Currently, no operator in 16.3.3.3.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/bitmask.types">[bitmask.types]</a>/2 is specified as <tt>noexcept</tt>, and the compound assignment 
operators are not specified as <tt>constexpr</tt>.
<p/>
Implementations are divergent on this. E.g., MSVC STL 
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/8f67ece4a654625220642c92fa029a5cfc77afa8/stl/inc/type_traits#L2266-L2297">consistently 
marks them <tt>constexpr</tt> and <tt>noexcept</tt></a> (given MSVC STL doesn't support pre-C++14 modes), while libstdc++'s 
<a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/fab08d12b40ad637c5a4ce8e026fb43cd3f0fad1/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits/regex_constants.h#L395-L408">compound 
assignment operators for <tt>match_flag_type</tt></a> are <tt>constexpr</tt> since C++14 but lack <tt>noexcept</tt>, and 
<a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/fab08d12b40ad637c5a4ce8e026fb43cd3f0fad1/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/std/future#L176-L183">the 
operators for <tt>launch</tt></a> are <tt>noexcept</tt> but not <tt>constexpr</tt>.
<p/>
I think it's better to ensure more consistency be integer types and non-integer bitmask types, i.e., require the 
compound assignment operators to be <tt>constexpr</tt> (only available in C++14 and later) and all operators to be <tt>noexcept</tt>.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In order to solve issues in LWG <a href="3787">3787</a> and LWG <a href="3847">3847</a> that the template parameter <tt>C</tt> 
can be specified as an unreasonable type, <tt>ranges::to</tt> adds a <i>Mandates</i> that requires <tt>C</tt> to be a 
<i>cv</i>-unqualified class type.
</p>
<p>
However, the earliest requirement that <tt>C</tt> not be a view was still imposed by the constraints of function signatures,
although it is unclear why <i>Constraints</i> were used in the first place, such a way of kicking out the function candidate 
does bring undesirable hard errors and poor diagnostics (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/K1f15K71n">demo</a>):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;ranges&gt;

int main() {
  auto iota = std::views::iota(0, 10);
  auto take = std::ranges::to&lt;std::ranges::take_view&gt;(iota, 5);  // <span style="color:red;font-weight:bolder">hard error in function body</span>
  auto drop = iota | std::ranges::to&lt;std::ranges::drop_view&gt;(5); // <span style="color:red;font-weight:bolder">poor diagnostics</span>
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
I think consistent use of <i>Mandates</i> for template parameter <tt>C</tt> is more appropriate, as <tt>static_assert</tt> 
provide clearer and more readable diagnostics.

Currently, both <tt>as_const_view</tt> and <tt>basic_const_iterator</tt> provide <tt>base()</tt> members to 
return the underlying range and iterator, which seems to expose vulnerabilities in modifying them:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>

  std::vector v{1, 2, 3};
  
  auto f = [](std::span&lt;int&gt;::const_iterator i) {
    *i.base() = 4;

  f(std::span{v}.cbegin());

  auto g = [](const std::ranges::constant_range auto&amp; r) {
    r.begin().base()[1] = 5;

Currently MSVC STL strictly diagnose the arithmetic between different <tt>span</tt>s/<tt>basic_string_view</tt>s, 
even the views are on the same underlying range (see <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/issues/1435">this Github issue</a>). 
libstdc++ and libc++ silently accept these operations.
<p/>
Perhaps the standard should clarify what the whole ranges are when determining whether operations between iterators 
from different views on the same underlying range is well-defined.

<p>
Recent discussions on <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/64644">llvm-64644</a>
came to the conclusion that <tt>basic_stringbuf() &amp;&amp;</tt> introduced by <a href="https://wg21.link/P0408">P0408</a>
might just copy the underlying buffer into a string object and not actually move the allocated space. 
While the wording tried to encourage that, especially with the postcondition that the buffer must 
be empty afterwards, it failed to specify that the move is never a copy.
<p/>
I suggest to amend the specification to enforce implementors to do the <tt>&#x1d4aa;(1)</tt> thing. 
There might be ABI issues for those who still copy.
<p/>
Some investigation into 24.2.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.reqmts">[container.reqmts]</a> p.16 and 23.4.3.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/basic.string.general">[basic.string.general]</a> 
shows that a <tt>basic_string</tt> as a standard container should move with <tt>&#x1d4aa;(1)</tt>.
<p/>
Unfortunately, we cannot say
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<ins><tt>str().data() == buf.data()</tt> before calling <tt>str()</tt></ins>

as a postcondition due to SSO. Maybe a note could be added to eliminate the confusion.

Format strings need to be checkable at compile-time since <a href="https://wg21.link/P2216R3">P2216R3</a>. In order to check a 
compile-time format string, the <tt>parse</tt> functions of the formatters need to be called. However, 
currently there is seemingly no requirement for the <tt>parse</tt> function to be <tt>constexpr</tt>,

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
26.7.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.adaptor.object">[range.adaptor.object]</a> p8 specifies that:
</p>
<blockquote><p> 
The expression <tt>adaptor(args...)</tt> produces a range adaptor closure object <tt>f</tt> that is a perfect forwarding 
call wrapper (22.10.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/func.require">[func.require]</a>) with the following properties:
</p></blockquote>
<p>
According to the subsequent description, it can be inferred that the behavior is similar to 
<tt>std::bind_back(adaptor, args...)</tt> which also returns a perfect forwarding call wrapper.
<p/>
Among them, "A <i>perfect forwarding call wrapper</i> is an argument forwarding call wrapper 
that forwards its state entities to the underlying call expression" according to <a href="https://wg21.link/func.require">[func.require]</a>/4, and call wrapper in <a href="https://wg21.link/func.require">[func.require]</a>/3 is described as:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Every call wrapper (22.10.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/func.def">[func.def]</a>) meets the <i>Cpp17MoveConstructible</i> and <i>Cpp17Destructible</i> requirements.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In order to conform with the specification, standard functions that return perfect forwarding call wrappers such as 
<tt>std::bind_front/back</tt> and <tt>std::not_fn</tt> all <i>Mandates</i> that 
<tt>(is_constructible_v&lt;BoundArgs, Args&gt; &amp;&amp; ...)</tt> and 
<tt>(is_move_constructible_v&lt;BoundArgs&gt; &amp;&amp; ...)</tt> are each <tt>true</tt>, 
the former condition corresponds to 26.7.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/range.adaptor.object">[range.adaptor.object]</a> p8:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The expression <tt>adaptor(args...)</tt> is well-formed if and only if the initialization of the bound argument 
entities of the result, as specified above, are all well-formed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
However, the latter does not have a corresponding description in <tt>&lt;ranges&gt;</tt>. In other words, range 
adaptor objects do not explicitly indicate that the bound argument must be move-constructible.
This results in implementation divergence for some uncommon types (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/r6Gq8W6qe">demo</a>):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;ranges&gt;
#include &lt;string_view&gt;

constexpr struct WeirdFive {
  WeirdFive() = default;
  WeirdFive(const WeirdFive&amp;) = default;
  constexpr operator int() const { return 5; }

  WeirdFive(WeirdFive&amp;&amp;) = delete;
} five;

constexpr std::string_view sv{"hello"};
static_assert(sv == std::views::take(five)(sv)); // <span style="color:red;font-weight:bolder">libstdc++/libc++ reject, MSVC-STL accepts</span>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Above, libstdc++ always moves arguments into internal members, which leads to hard errors in the member initializer list;
libc++ uses <tt>std::bind_back</tt> for argument binding, which also leads to hard errors in the function body as the 
former requires arguments to be move-constructible; MSVC-STL is the most compliant with current wording.

<p>
Above, <tt>is_convertible_v&lt;Indices, index_type&gt;</tt> implies that <tt>index_type</tt> can be constructed through 
rvalue-qualified conversion operators. However, we cast the lvalue <tt>i</tt> in the return statement, which makes the 
expression possibly ill-formed. The same goes for <tt>extents_type::<i>index-cast(i)</i></tt>.
</p>
<p>
However, if we use <tt>std::move</tt> before casting, this will result in the rvalue-qualified conversion operator 
being called in <i>Preconditions</i> via <tt>extents_type::<i>index-cast(i)</i></tt> before the mapping index is actually calculated,
so that the expression may no longer be valid. And such an issue already exists in <tt>mdspan::operator[]</tt>.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the variadic version of <tt>mdspan::operator[]</tt> constraints 
<tt>is_convertible_v&lt;OtherIndexTypes, index_type&gt;</tt>, but its <tt>array</tt>/<tt>span</tt> version constraints 
<tt>is_convertible_v&lt;const OtherIndexType&amp;, index_type&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
This seems to bring inconsistency as <tt>mdspan[arr]</tt> may not necessarily guarantee <tt>mdspan[arr[i]...]</tt>.
</p>
<p>
I think we should unanimously require that custom indexes can be converted to <tt>index_type</tt> via <tt>const</tt> 
lvalue references, which eliminates the worry of conversion expiration.

<p>
22.14.6.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/format.formatter.spec">[format.formatter.spec]</a>/2 requires some <tt>std::formatter</tt> specializations are only enabled 
for character types <tt>char</tt> and <tt>wchar_t</tt>. But for specializations that are explicitly shown in 
the synopses (22.14.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/format.syn">[format.syn]</a>, 29.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.syn">[time.syn]</a>, and 33.4.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.thread.id">[thread.thread.id]</a>), 
there is no such restrictions for <tt>charT</tt>. The difference may be observable via the <tt>std::formattable</tt>

there would be a hard error during formatting due to <tt><i>STATICALLY-WIDEN</i></tt>.
<p/>
Perhaps we should introduce an exposition-only concept that is only satisfied (and modeled) by <tt>char</tt> and 
<tt>wchar_t</tt> for now, and constrain the <tt>charT</tt> template parameter of all <tt>std::formatter</tt>

<p>
Currently, MSVC STL and libc++ implement constants in <tt>std::regex_constants</tt> as 
enumerators of unscoped enumerations, while the standard specify them to be <tt>constexpr</tt> variables.
<p/>
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/issues/4100#issuecomment-1767717721">Casey Carter argued</a> 
that it would be better to make these constants prvalues to avoid wasting space in object files. And 
presumably almost all users just use their values without odr-using them or relying on their value category.
<p/>
Perhaps we should allow these constants to be enumerators of the corresponding type (<tt>syntax_option_type</tt>, 
<tt>match_flag_type</tt>, or <tt>error_type</tt>) if the corresponding type is an enumeration.
<p/>
Notes: since C++20, we can even make the enumeration types scoped and expose the enumerators to the 
namespace by using-declaration or using-enum-declaration. <a href="https://wg21.link/P0439R0">P0439R0</a> might be related, 
since it changed former enumerators to <tt>constexpr</tt> variables.

<a href="https://wg21.link/P0439R0">P0439R0</a> made <tt>std::memory_order</tt> an scoped enumeration type. However, it also 
changed former enumerators (<tt>std::memory_order_seq_cst</tt>) to <tt>constexpr</tt> variables.
<p/>
It is unclear the additional change is intended while it presumably bothered nobody in practice. 
Given there is <tt>using enum</tt> (<a href="https://wg21.link/P1099R5">P1099R5</a>) in C++20, it may be better to keep 
these constants being prvalues.

<p>
What do the store and load operations intend to mean in this context? If there is no extra specification, 
it is easy to consider them as the operations performed by the non-static member functions "store" and "load" 
defined in the <tt>atomic</tt> class (template).
<p/>

</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
An atomic operation <i>A</i> that performs a release operation on an atomic object <i>M</i> synchronizes with 
an atomic operation <i>B</i> that performs an acquire operation on <i>M</i> and takes its value from any side 
effect in the release sequence headed by <i>A</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
According to the above interpretation, <i>A</i> is an operation performed by the non-static member function 
<tt>store</tt>, however, I think the following example can establish the synchronization relationship
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::atomic&lt;int&gt; x{0};
Thread 1:
int expected = 0;
x.compare_exchange_strong(expected, 1, memory_order::release, memory_order::relaxed ); //#1

Thread 2:
int expected = 1;
while(x.compare_exchange_strong( expected, 2, memory_order::acquire, memory_order::relaxed )){} // #2
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Assuming the RMW operations are successful in the two threads, I think <tt>#1</tt> intends to perform a 
release operation while <tt>#2</tt> performs an acquire operation, and hence they can establish the 
synchronization relationship, however, they both are RMW operations.
<p/>
It should be clearly defined which are store operations and which are load operations.

<p>
The library's definition of the term "required behavior" (3.49 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/defns.required.behavior">[defns.required.behavior]</a>) makes it specific to 
certain replaceable functions such as the replaceable global allocation functions. Notably, it is not one of the elements 
that are allowed to appear in the descriptions of general function semantics. That is, it isn't in the list in 
16.3.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/structure.specifications">[structure.specifications]</a> p3.
<p/>
However, the specification of the random number generator library uses "Required behavior" as such a descriptive element 
of its functions' semantics (e.g., 28.5.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/rand.predef">[rand.predef]</a>).
<p/>
I think that's a fine use of "Required behavior", so I would like the term to be more generally applicable to the behavior 
of any stdlib function that may be customized by users. This is relevant for <tt>std::execution</tt>, where algorithms are 
customizable but the customizations are required to behave a certain way. 
<p/>
<b>Daniel:</b>
<p/>
Bullet (2.4) of 16.4.5.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/res.on.functions">[res.on.functions]</a> also contradicts to the more narrow definition of 
3.49 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/defns.required.behavior">[defns.required.behavior]</a> by suddenly extending it to "destructor operations".

<p>
The "shall" seemingly indicates a requirement for user codes that calling a volatile perfect forwarding 
call wrapper is undefined behavior. Such requirement seems to be combined with requirements for 
implementations in an unusual way.
<p/>
Moreover, it is unclear whether UB is intended here. Perhaps we only want calling such a <tt>volatile</tt> 
wrapper to be conditionally-supported. E.g. when the <tt>operator()</tt> happens to be implementable as a 
static member function, calling a <tt>volatile</tt> wrapper can be naturally supported and have expected 
behavior.
