<p>
A third party test suite tries to exercise <tt>istream::ignore(N)</tt> with a negative value of 
<tt>N</tt> and expects that the implementation will treat <tt>N</tt> as if it were <tt>0</tt>. Our 
implementation asserts that (<tt>N &gt;= 0</tt>) holds and aborts the test.
</p>

<p>
I can't find anything in section 27 that prohibits such values but I don't
see what the effects of such calls should be, either (this applies to
a number of unformatted input functions as well as some member functions
of the <tt>basic_streambuf</tt> template).

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>From comp.std.c++:</p>

<p>
I note that given an input iterator a for type <tt>T</tt>, 
then <tt>*a</tt> only has to be "convertable to <tt>T</tt>", 
not actually of type <tt>T</tt>.
</p>

<p>Firstly, I can't seem to find an exact definition of "convertable to <tt>T</tt>". 
While I assume it is the obvious definition (an implicit conversion), I 
can't find an exact definition. Is there one?</p>

<p>Slightly more worryingly, there doesn't seem to be any restriction on 
the this type, other than it is "convertable to <tt>T</tt>". Consider two input 
iterators <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>. I would personally assume that most people would 
expect <tt>*a==*b</tt> would perform <tt>T(*a)==T(*b)</tt>, however it doesn't seem that 
the standard requires that, and that whatever type <tt>*a</tt> is (call it <tt>U</tt>) 
could have == defined on it with totally different symantics and still 
be a valid inputer iterator.</p>

<p>Is this a correct reading? When using input iterators should I write 
<tt>T(*a)</tt> all over the place to be sure that the object I'm using is the 
class I expect?</p>

<p>This is especially a nuisance for operations that are defined to be
  "convertible to <tt>bool</tt>".  (This is probably allowed so that
  implementations could return say an <tt>int</tt> and avoid an unnessary
  conversion. However all implementations I have seen simply return a
  <tt>bool</tt> anyway.  Typical implemtations of STL algorithms just write
  things like <tt>while(a!=b &amp;&amp; *a!=0)</tt>.  But strictly
  speaking, there are lots of types that are convertible to <tt>T</tt> but
  that also overload the appropriate operators so this doesn't behave
  as expected.</p>

<p>If we want to make code like this legal (which most people seem to
  expect), then we'll need to tighten up what we mean by "convertible
  to <tt>T</tt>".</p>

<p><i>[Lillehammer: The first part is NAD, since "convertible" is
 well-defined in core. The second part is basically about pathological

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
A problem with TR1 regex is currently being discussed on the Boost 
developers list. It involves the handling of case-insensitive matching 
of character ranges such as [Z-a]. The proper behavior (according to the 
ECMAScript standard) is unimplementable given the current specification 
of the TR1 <tt>regex_traits&lt;&gt;</tt> class template. John Maddock, the author of 
the TR1 regex proposal, agrees there is a problem. The full discussion 
can be found at http://lists.boost.org/boost/2005/06/28850.php (first 
message copied below). We don't have any recommendations as yet.
</p>
<p>
-- Begin original message --
</p>
<p>
The situation of interest is described in the ECMAScript specification
(ECMA-262), section 15.10.2.15:
</p>
<p>
"Even if the pattern ignores case, the case of the two ends of a range
is significant in determining which characters belong to the range.
Thus, for example, the pattern /[E-F]/i matches only the letters E, F,
e, and f, while the pattern /[E-f]/i matches all upper and lower-case
ASCII letters as well as the symbols [, \, ], ^, _, and `."
</p>
<p>
A more interesting case is what should happen when doing a
case-insensitive match on a range such as [Z-a]. It should match z, Z,
a, A and the symbols [, \, ], ^, _, and `. This is not what happens with
Boost.Regex (it throws an exception from the regex constructor).
</p>
<p>
The tough pill to swallow is that, given the specification in TR1, I
don't think there is any effective way to handle this situation.
According to the spec, case-insensitivity is handled with
<tt>regex_traits&lt;&gt;::translate_nocase(CharT)</tt> &mdash; two characters are equivalent
if they compare equal after both are sent through the <tt>translate_nocase</tt>
function. But I don't see any way of using this translation function to
make character ranges case-insensitive. Consider the difficulty of
detecting whether "z" is in the range [Z-a]. Applying the transformation
to "z" has no effect (it is essentially <tt>std::tolower</tt>). And we're not
allowed to apply the transformation to the ends of the range, because as
ECMA-262 says, "the case of the two ends of a range is significant."
</p>
<p>
So AFAICT, TR1 regex is just broken, as is Boost.Regex. One possible fix
is to redefine translate_nocase to return a string_type containing all
the characters that should compare equal to the specified character. But
this function is hard to implement for Unicode, and it doesn't play nice
with the existing ctype facet. What a mess!
</p>
<p>

<p><i>[
John Maddock adds:

<p>
One small correction, I have since found that ICU's regex package does 
implement this correctly, using a similar mechanism to the current 
TR1.Regex.
</p>
<p>
Given an expression [c1-c2] that is compiled as case insensitive it:
</p>
<p>
Enumerates every character in the range c1 to c2 and converts it to it's 
case folded equivalent.  That case folded character is then used a key to a 
table of equivalence classes, and each member of the class is added to the 
list of possible matches supported by the character-class.  This second step 
isn't possible with our current traits class design, but isn't necessary if 
the input text is also converted to a case-folded equivalent on the fly.
</p>
<p>
ICU applies similar brute force mechanisms to character classes such as 
[[:lower:]] and [[:word:]], however these are at least cached, so the impact 
is less noticeable in this case.
</p>
<p>
Quick and dirty performance comparisons show that expressions such as 
"[X-\\x{fff0}]+" are indeed very slow to compile with ICU (about 200 times 
slower than a "normal" expression).  For an application that uses a lot of 
regexes this could have a noticeable performance impact.  ICU also has an 
advantage in that it knows the range of valid characters codes: code points 
outside that range are assumed not to require enumeration, as they can not 
be part of any equivalence class.  I presume that if we want the TR1.Regex 
to work with arbitrarily large character sets enumeration really does become 
impractical.
</p>
<p>
Finally note that Unicode has:
</p>
<p>
Three cases (upper, lower and title).
One to many, and many to one case transformations.
Character that have context sensitive case translations - for example an 
uppercase sigma has two different lowercase forms  - the form chosen depends 
on context(is it end of a word or not), a caseless match for an upper case 
sigma should match either of the lower case forms, which is why case folding 
is often approximated by tolower(toupper(c)).
</p>
<p>
Probably we need some way to enumerate character equivalence classes, 
including digraphs (either as a result or an input), and some way to tell 
whether the next character pair is a valid digraph in the current locale.
</p>
<p>
Hoping this doesn't make this even more complex that it was already,

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>



<p>
32.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.mutex.requirements">[thread.mutex.requirements]</a> describes the requirements for a type to be
a "Mutex type". A Mutex type can be used as the template argument for
the <tt>Lock</tt> type that's passed to <tt>condition_variable_any::wait</tt> (although
<tt>Lock</tt> seems like the wrong name here, since <tt>Lock</tt> is given a different
formal meaning in 32.4.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.lock">[thread.lock]</a>) and, although the WD doesn't quite say
so, as the template argument for <tt>lock_guard</tt> and <tt>unique_lock</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The requirements for a Mutex type include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<tt>m.lock()</tt> shall be well-formed and have [described] semantics, including a return type of <tt>void</tt>.
</li>
<li>
<tt>m.try_lock()</tt> shall be well-formed and have [described] semantics, including a return type of <tt>bool</tt>.
</li>
<li>
<tt>m.unlock()</tt> shall be well-formed and have [described] semantics, including a return type of <tt>void</tt>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, a Mutex type "shall not be copyable nor movable".
</p>

<p>
The latter requirement seems completely irrelevant, and the three
requirements on return types are tighter than they need to be. For
example, there's no reason that <tt>lock_guard</tt> can't be instantiated with a
type that's copyable. The rule is, in fact, that <tt>lock_guard</tt>, etc. won't
try to copy objects of that type. That's a constraint on locks, not on
mutexes. Similarly, the requirements for <tt>void</tt> return types are
unnecessary; the rule is, in fact, that <tt>lock_guard</tt>, etc. won't use any
returned value. And with the return type of <tt>bool</tt>, the requirement should
be that the return type is convertible to <tt>bool</tt>.

The intention is not only to place a constraint on what types such as

code, may do with mutex types. Thus the constraints as they are apply to
the mutex types themselves, not the current users of mutex types in the

<p>
Section 32.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.mutex.requirements">[thread.mutex.requirements]</a> conflates the
requirements on a generic Mutex type (including user-supplied mutexes)
with the requirements placed on the standard-supplied mutex types in an
attempt to group everything together and save space.
</p>
<p>
When applying concepts to chapter 30, I suggest that the concepts

*use* of a mutex type as required by
<tt>unique_lock/lock_guard/condition_variable_any</tt>. These should be

<p>
When I look at the <tt>unordered_*</tt> constructors, I think the complexity is poorly
described and does not follow the style of the rest of the standard.
</p>

<p>
The complexity for the default constructor is specified as constant.
Actually, it is proportional to <tt>n</tt>, but there are no invocations of
<tt>value_type</tt> constructors or other <tt>value_type</tt> operations.
</p>

<p>
For the iterator-based constructor the complexity should be:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Complexity:</i> exactly <tt>n</tt> calls to construct <tt>value_type</tt>
from <tt>InputIterator::value_type</tt> (where <tt>n = distance(f,l)</tt>).
The number of calls to <tt>key_equal::operator()</tt> is proportional to
<tt>n</tt> in the average case and <tt>n*n</tt> in the worst case.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>[
2010 Rapperswil:
]</i></p>


<blockquote><p>
Concern that the current wording may require O(1) where that cannot be delivered.  We need to look at 
both the clause 23 requirements tables and the constructor description of each unordered container to be sure.
</p>
<p>
Howard suggests NAD Editorial as we updated the container requirement tables since this issue was written.
</p>
<p>
Daniel offers to look deeper, and hopefully produce wording addressing any outstanding concerns at the next meeting.
</p>
<p>
Move to Open.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>[2011-02-26: Daniel provides wording]</i></p>


<p>I strongly suggest to clean-up the differences between requirement tables and individual
specifications. In the usual way, the most specific specifications wins, which is in this
case the wrong one. In regard to the concern expressed about missing <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>
requirements of the value type I disagree: The function argument <tt>n</tt> is no size-control
parameter, but only some effective capacity parameter: No elements will be value-initialized
by these constructors. The necessary requirement for the value type, <tt>EmplaceConstructible</tt>
into <tt>*this</tt>, is already listed in Table 103 &mdash; Unordered associative container requirements.
Another part of the proposed resolution is the fact that there is an inconsistency of the
complexity counting when both a range <strong>and</strong> a bucket count is involved compared
to constructions where only bucket counts are provided: E.g. the construction <tt>X a(n);</tt>
has a complexity of <tt>n</tt> bucket allocations, but this part of the work is omitted for
<tt>X a(i, j, n);</tt>, even though it is considerable larger (in the average case) for 
<tt>n &#8811; distance(i, j)</tt>.
</p>

<p><i>[2011-03-24 Madrid meeting]</i></p>


<p>Move to deferred</p>

<p><i>[
2011 Bloomington
]</i></p>


<p>
The proposed wording looks good.  Move to Review.
</p>

<p><i>[2012, Kona]</i></p>

<p>
Fix up some presentation issues with the wording, combining the big-O expressions into single
expressions rather than the sum of two separate big-Os.
</p>
<p>
Strike "constant or linear", prefer "linear in the number of buckets".
This allows for number of buckets being larger than requested <tt>n</tt> as well.
</p>
<p>
Default <tt>n</tt> to "unspecified" rather than "implementation-defined".  It seems an un-necessary
burden asking vendors to document a quantity that is easily determined through the public API of
these classes.
</p>
<p>
Replace <tt>distance(f,l)</tt> with "number of elements in the range <tt>[f,l)</tt>"
</p>
<p>
Retain in Review with the updated wording
</p>

<p><i>[2012, Portland: Move to Open]</i></p>

<p>
The wording still does not call out Pablo's original concern, that the element constructor is called
no more than <tt>N</tt> times, and that the <tt>N</tt> squared term applies to moves during rehash.
</p>

<p>
Inconsistent use of O(n)+O(N) vs. O(n+N), with a preference for the former.
</p>

<p>
AJM to update wording with a reference to "no more than <tt>N</tt> element constructor calls".
</p>

<p>
Matt concerned that calling out the O(n) requirements is noise, and dangerous noise in suggesting a precision
we do not mean.  The cost of constructing a bucket is very different to constructing an element of user-supplied
type.
</p>

<p>
AJM notes that if there are multiple rehashes, the 'n' complexity is probably not linear.
</p>

<p>
Matt suggests back to Open, Pablo suggests potentially NAD if we keep revisitting without achieving a resolution.
</p>

<p>
Matt suggests complexity we are concerned with is the number of operations, such as constructing elements, moving
nodes, and comparing/hashing keys.  We are less concerned with constructing buckets, which are generally noise in
this bigger picture.
</p>

<p><i>[2015-01-29 Telecon]</i></p>

<p>
AM: essentially correct, but do we want to complicate the spec?
<p/>
HH: Pablo has given us permission to NAD it
<p/>
JM: when I look at the first change in the P/R I find it mildly disturbing that the existing wording says you have a 
constant time constructor with a single element even if your <tt>n</tt> is 10^6, so I think adding this change makes people 
aware there might be a large cost in initializing the hash table, even though it doesn't show up in user-visible constructions.
<p/>
HH: one way to avoid that problem is make the default ctor <tt>noexcept</tt>. Then the container isn't allowed to create 
an arbitrarily large hash table
<p/>
AM: but this is the constructor where the user provides <tt>n</tt>
<p/>
MC: happy with the changes, except I agree with the editorial recommendation to keep the two &#x1d4aa;s separate.
<p/>
JW: yes, the constant '<tt>k</tt>' is different in &#x1d4aa;(n) and &#x1d4aa;(N)
<p/>
GR: do we want to talk about buckets at all
<p/>
JM: yes, good to highlight that bucket construction might be a significant cost
<p/>
HH: suggest we take the suggestion to split &#x1d4aa;(n+N) to &#x1d4aa;(n)+&#x1d4aa;(N) and move to Tentatively Ready
<p/>
GR: 23.2.1p2 says all complexity requirements are stated solely in terms of the number of operations on the contained 
object, so we shouldn't be stating complexity in terms of the hash table initialization
<p/>
HH: channeling Pete, there's an implicit "unless otherwise specified" everywhere.
<p/>
VV: seem to be requesting modifications that render this not Tentatively Ready
<p/>
GR: I think it can't be T/R
<p/>
AM: make the editorial recommendation, consider fixing 23.2.1/3 to give us permission to state complexity in terms 
of bucket initialization
<p/>
HH: only set it to Review after we get new wording to review

<p>
29.7.5.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/ostream.rvalue">[ostream.rvalue]</a> was created to preserve the ability to insert
into (and extract from 29.7.4.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/istream.rvalue">[istream.rvalue]</a>) rvalue streams:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class charT, class traits, class T&gt;
  basic_ostream&lt;charT, traits&gt;&amp;
  operator&lt;&lt;(basic_ostream&lt;charT, traits&gt;&amp;&amp; os, const T&amp; x);
</pre>

<p>

<p>
2 <i>Returns:</i> <tt>os</tt>
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is good as it allows code that wants to (for example) open, write to, and
close an <tt>ofstream</tt> all in one statement:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
std::ofstream("log file") &lt;&lt; "Some message\n";
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
However, I think we can easily make this "rvalue stream helper" even easier to
use.  Consider trying to quickly create a formatted string.  With the current
spec you have to write:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
std::string s = static_cast&lt;std::ostringstream&amp;&gt;(std::ostringstream() &lt;&lt; "i = " &lt;&lt; i).str();
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This will store "<tt>i = 10</tt>" (for example) in the string <tt>s</tt>.  Note
the need to cast the stream back to <tt>ostringstream&amp;</tt> prior to using
the member <tt>.str()</tt>.  This is necessary because the inserter has cast
the <tt>ostringstream</tt> down to a more generic <tt>ostream</tt> during the
insertion process.
</p>

<p>
I believe we can re-specify the rvalue-inserter so that this cast is unnecessary.
Thus our customer now has to only type:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
std::string s = (std::ostringstream() &lt;&lt; "i = " &lt;&lt; i).str();
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This is accomplished by having the rvalue stream inserter return an rvalue of
the same type, instead of casting it down to the base class.  This is done by
making the stream generic, and constraining it to be an rvalue of a type derived

<p><i>[2018-12-03, Ville comments]</i></p>

<p>
The implementation in libstdc++ doesn't require derivation from <tt>ios_base</tt>, it 
requires convertibility to <tt>basic_istream/basic_ostream</tt>. This has been found to be 
important to avoid regressions with existing stream wrappers.
<p/>
In libstdc++, the inserter/extractor also don't return a reference to the template parameter, 
they return a reference to the <tt>basic_istream/basic_ostream</tt> <em>specialization</em>
the template parameter converts to. This was done in order to try and be closer to the earlier 
specification's return type, which specified <tt>basic_ostream&lt;charT, traits&gt;&amp;</tt>
and <tt>basic_istream&lt;charT, traits&gt;&amp;</tt>. So we detected convertibility to
(a type convertible to) those, and returned the result of that conversion. That doesn't seem to 
be necessary, and probably bothers certain chaining cases. Based on recent experiments, it seems
that this return-type dance (as opposed to just returning what the p/r suggests) is unnecessary, 
and doesn't trigger any regressions.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The terms <em>valid</em> iterator and <em>singular</em> aren't
properly defined. The fuzziness of those terms became even worse
after the resolution of <a href="208">208</a> (including further updates by <a href="278">278</a>). In
23.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.requirements">[iterator.requirements]</a> as of
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2723.pdf">N2723</a>
the standard says now:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
5 - These values are called past-the-end values. Values of an iterator <tt>i</tt> for
which the expression <tt>*i</tt> is defined are called dereferenceable. The library
never assumes that past-the-end values are dereferenceable. Iterators
can also have singular values that are not associated with any
container. [...] Results of most expressions are undefined for singular
values; the only exceptions are destroying an iterator that holds a
singular value and the assignment of a non-singular value to an iterator
that holds a singular value. [...] Dereferenceable values are always
non-singular.
</p>

<p>
10 - An invalid iterator is an iterator that may be singular.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
First, issue <a href="208">208</a> intentionally removed the earlier constraint that past-the-end
values are always non-singular. The reason for this was to support null
pointers as past-the-end iterators of e.g. empty sequences. But there
seem to exist different views on what a singular (iterator) value is. E.g.
according to the <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/trivial.html">SGI definition</a>
a null pointer is <em>not</em> a singular value:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Dereferenceable iterators are always nonsingular, but the converse is
not true.
For example, a null pointer is nonsingular (there are well defined operations
involving null pointers) even thought it is not dereferenceable.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
and <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/InputIterator.html">proceeds</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
An iterator is valid if it is dereferenceable or past-the-end.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Even if the standard prefers a different meaning of singular here, the
change was incomplete, because by restricting feasible expressions of singular
iterators to destruction and assignment isn't sufficient for a past-the-end
iterator: Of-course it must still be equality-comparable and in general be a readable value.
</p>

<p>
Second, the standard doesn't clearly say whether a past-the-end value is
a valid iterator or not. E.g. 20.10.11 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/specialized.algorithms">[specialized.algorithms]</a>/1 says:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
In all of the following algorithms, the formal template parameter <tt>ForwardIterator</tt> 
is required to satisfy the requirements of a forward iterator (24.1.3)
[..], and is required to have the property that no exceptions are thrown from [..], or
dereference of valid iterators.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The standard should make better clear what "singular pointer" and "valid
iterator" means. The fact that the meaning of a valid <em>value</em>
has a core language meaning doesn't imply that for an iterator concept
the term "valid iterator" has the same meaning.
</p>

<p>
Let me add a final example: In 99 [allocator.concepts.members] of
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2914.pdf">N2914</a>
we find:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
pointer X::allocate(size_type n);
</pre>

<blockquote><p>
11 <i>Returns:</i> a pointer to the allocated memory. [<i>Note:</i> if <tt>n == 0</tt>, the return
value is unspecified. &mdash;<i>end note</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
[..]
</p>

<pre>
void X::deallocate(pointer p, size_type n);
</pre>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Preconditions:</i> <tt>p</tt> shall be a non-singular pointer value obtained from a call
to <tt>allocate()</tt> on this allocator or one that compares equal to it.
</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
If singular pointer value would include null pointers this make the
preconditions
unclear if the pointer value is a result of <tt>allocate(0)</tt>: Since the return value
is unspecified, it could be a null pointer. Does that mean that programmers
need to check the pointer value for a null value before calling deallocate?

<p><b>View all issues with</b> <a href="lwg-status.html#Open">Open</a> status.</p>
<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The library has many algorithms that take a source range represented by
a pair of iterators, and the start of some second sequence given by a
single iterator. Internally, these algorithms will produce undefined
behaviour if the second 'range' is not as large as the input range, but
none of the algorithms spell this out in Requires clauses, and there is
no catch-all wording to cover this in clause 17 or the front matter of
25.
</p>

<p>
There was an attempt to provide such wording in paper <a href="http://wg21.link/n2944">n2944</a>
but this seems incidental to the focus of the paper, and getting the wording of
this issue right seems substantially more difficult than the simple
approach taken in that paper.  Such wording will be removed from an
updated paper, and hopefully tracked via the LWG issues list instead.
</p>

<p>
It seems there are several classes of problems here and finding wording
to solve all in one paragraph could be too much.  I suspect we need
several overlapping requirements that should cover the desired range of
behaviours.
</p>

<p>
Motivating examples:
</p>

<p>
A good initial example is the <tt>swap_ranges</tt> algorithm.  Here there is a
clear requirement that <tt>first2</tt> refers to the start of a valid range at
least as long as the range <tt>[first1, last1)</tt>.  <a href="http://wg21.link/n2944">n2944</a> tries to solve this
by positing a hypothetical <tt>last2</tt> iterator that is implied by the
signature, and requires <tt>distance(first2,last2) &lt; distance(first1,last1)</tt>.
 This mostly works, although I am uncomfortable assuming that <tt>last2</tt> is
clearly defined and well known without any description of how to obtain
it (and I have no idea how to write that).
</p>

<p>
A second motivating example might be the <tt>copy</tt> algorithm.  Specifically,
let us image a call like:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
copy(istream_iterator&lt;int&gt;(is),istream_iterator(),ostream_iterator&lt;int&gt;(os));
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In this case, our input iterators are literally simple <tt>InputIterators</tt>,
and the destination is a simple <tt>OutputIterator</tt>.  In neither case am I
happy referring to <tt>std::distance</tt>, in fact it is not possible for the
<tt>ostream_iterator</tt> at all as it does not meet the requirements.  However,
any wording we provide must cover both cases.  Perhaps we might deduce
<tt>last2 == ostream_iterator&lt;int&gt;{}</tt>, but that might not always be valid for
user-defined iterator types.  I can well imagine an 'infinite range'
that writes to <tt>/dev/null</tt> and has no meaningful <tt>last2</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The motivating example in <a href="http://wg21.link/n2944">n2944</a> is <tt>std::equal</tt>, 
and that seems to fall somewhere between the two.
</p>

<p>
Outlying examples might be <tt>partition_copy</tt> that takes two output
iterators, and the <tt>_n</tt> algorithms where a range is specified by a
specific number of iterations, rather than traditional iterator pair. 
We should also <em>not</em> accidentally apply inappropriate constraints to
<tt>std::rotate</tt> which takes a third iterator that is not intended to be a
separate range at all.
</p>

<p>
I suspect we want some wording similar to:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
For algorithms that operate on ranges where the end iterator of the
second range is not specified, the second range shall contain at least
as many elements as the first.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
I don't think this quite captures the intent yet though.  I am not sure
if 'range' is the right term here rather than sequence.  More awkwardly,
I am not convinced we can describe an Output sequence such as produce by
an <tt>ostream_iterator</tt> as "containing elements", at least not as a
precondition to the call before they have been written.
</p>

<p>
Another idea was to describe require that the trailing iterator support
at least distance(input range) applications of <tt>operator++</tt> and may be
written through the same number of times if a mutable/output iterator.
</p>

<p>
We might also consider handling the case of an output range vs. an input
range in separate paragraphs, if that simplifies how we describe some of
these constraints.

<tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt> iterators are not random access iterators

<p>
Either revise the iterator requirements to support proxy iterators

The consensus at Rapperswil is that it is too late for full support for
proxy iterators, but requiring the library to respect <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt>

this container as deliberately incompatible with standard library algorithms.

<p>
31.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.lockfree">[atomics.lockfree]</a> p.8 states:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
An atomic store shall only store a value that has
been computed from constants and program input values
by a finite sequence of program evaluations, such
that each evaluation observes the values of variables
as computed by the last prior assignment in the
sequence.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
... but 6.8.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.execution">[intro.execution]</a> p.13 states:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If A is not sequenced before B and B is not
sequenced before A, then A and B are unsequenced.
[ <em>Note</em>: The execution of unsequenced
evaluations can overlap. &mdash; <em>end note</em> ]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Overlapping executions can make it impossible to
construct the sequence described in 31.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.lockfree">[atomics.lockfree]</a> p.8. We are not
sure of the intention here and do not offer a suggestion for
change, but note that 31.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.lockfree">[atomics.lockfree]</a> p.8 is the condition that prevents
out-of-thin-air reads.
</p>
<p>
For an example, suppose we have a function invocation
f(e1,e2). The evaluations of e1 and e2 can overlap.
Suppose that the evaluation of e1 writes y and reads x
whereas the evaluation of e2 reads y and writes x, with
reads-from edges as below (all this is within a single
thread).
</p>
<pre>
 e1           e2
Wrlx y--   --Wrlx x
      rf\ /rf
         X
        / \
Rrlx x&lt;-   -&gt;Rrlx y
</pre>
<p>
This seems like it should be allowed, but there seems to
be no way to produce a sequence of evaluations with the
property above.
</p>
<p>
In more detail, here the two evaluations, e1 and e2, are
being executed as the arguments of a function and are
consequently not sequenced-before each other. In
practice we'd expect that they could overlap (as allowed
by 6.8.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.execution">[intro.execution]</a> p.13), with the two writes taking effect before the two
reads. However, if we have to construct a linear order of
evaluations, as in 31.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.lockfree">[atomics.lockfree]</a> p.8, then the execution above is not
permited. Is that really intended?

<p><i>[2011-03-09 Hans comments:]</i></p>


<p>I'm not proud of 31.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p9 (formerly p8), and I agree with the comments that this
isn't entirely satisfactory. 31.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p9 was designed to preclude
out-of-thin-air results for races among <tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt> atomics, in spite of 
the fact that Java experience has shown we don't really know how to do that adequately. In 
the long run, we probably want to revisit this.
<p/>
However, in the short term, I'm still inclined to declare this NAD, for two separate reasons:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>6.8.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.execution">[intro.execution]</a> p15 states: "If a side effect on a scalar
object is unsequenced relative to either another side
effect on the same scalar object or a value computation
using the value of the same scalar object, the behavior is undefined."
I think the examples presented here have undefined behavior as a result.
It's not completely clear to me whether examples can be constructed
that exhibit this problem, and don't have undefined behavior.</p></li>

<li><p>This comment seems to be using a different meaning of "evaluation"
from what is used elsewhere in the standard. The sequence of evaluations
here doesn't have to consist of full expression evaluations.  They
can be evaluations of operations like lvalue to rvalue conversion,
or individual assignments. In particular, the reads and writes
executed by <tt>e1</tt> and <tt>e2</tt> in the example could be treated as separate
evaluations for purposes of producing the sequence.
The definition of "sequenced before" in 6.8.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.execution">[intro.execution]</a> makes
little sense if the term "evaluation" is restricted to any notion
of complete expression. Perhaps we should add yet another note
to clarify this?  31.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p10 probably leads to 
the wrong impression here.
<p/>
An alternative resolution would be to simply delete our flakey
attempt at preventing out-of-thin-air reads, by removing 31.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p9-11,
possibly adding a note that explains that we technically allow,
but strongly discourage them. If we were starting this from scratch
now, that would probably be my preference.  But it seems like too drastic
a resolution at this stage.

<p>
The standard doesn't say that containers should use abstract pointer 
types internally. Both Howard and Pablo agree that this is the intent. 
Further, it is necessary for containers to be stored, for example, in 
shared memory with an interprocess allocator (the type of scenario that 
allocators are intended to support).
</p>
<p>
In spite of the (possible) agreement on intent, it is necessary to make 
this explicit:
</p>
<p>
An implementations may like to store the result of dereferencing the 
pointer (which is a raw reference) as an optimization, but that prevents 
the data structure from being put in shared memory, etc. In fact, a 
container could store raw references to the allocator, which would be a 
little weird but conforming as long as it has one by-value copy. 
Furthermore, pointers to locales, ctypes, etc. may be there, which also 
prevents the data structure from being put in shared memory, so we 
should make explicit that a container does not store raw pointers or 
references at all.

<p>During the Pittsburgh meeting the proposal <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3066.html">N3066</a>
became accepted because it fixed several severe issues related to the iterator specification. But the current working draft (N3225)
does not reflect all these changes. Since I'm unaware whether every correction can be done editorial, this issue is submitted to take
care of that. To give one example: All expressions of Table 108 &mdash; &quot;Output iterator requirements&quot; have a post-condition
that the iterator is incrementable. This is impossible, because it would exclude any finite sequence that is accessed by an output 
iterator, such as a pointer to a C array. The N3066 wording changes did not have these effects.
</p>

<p><i>[2011-03-01: Daniel comments:]</i></p>


<p>This issue has some overlap with the issue <a href="2038">2038</a> and I would prefer if we
could solve both at one location. I suggest the following approach:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The terms <tt><i>dereferencable</i></tt> and <tt><i>incrementable</i></tt> could be defined in a more
general way not restricted to iterators (similar to the concepts <tt>HasDereference</tt> and 
<tt>HasPreincrement</tt> from working draft N2914). But on the other hand, all current usages of 
<tt><i>dereferencable</i></tt> and <tt><i>incrementable</i></tt> are involved with types that satisfy 
iterator requirements. Thus, I believe that it is sufficient for C++0x to add corresponding definitions to 
23.3.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.requirements.general">[iterator.requirements.general]</a> and to let all previous usages of these terms refer to this 
sub-clause. Since the same problem occurs with the past-the-end iterator, this proposal suggest providing 
similar references to usages that precede its definition as well.
</p></li>
<li><p>We also need to ensure that all iterator expressions get either an operational semantics in
terms of others or we need to add missing pre- and post-conditions. E.g. we have the following
ones without semantics:
</p><blockquote><pre>
*r++ = o // output iterator
*r--     // bidirectional iterator
</pre></blockquote><p>
According to the <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/OutputIterator.html">SGI specification</a>
these correspond to
</p><blockquote><pre>
{ *r = o; ++r; }                         // output iterator
{ reference tmp = *r; --r; return tmp; } // bidirectional iterator
</pre></blockquote><p>
respectively. Please note especially the latter expression for bidirectional iterator. It fixes a problem
that we have for forward iterator as well: Both these iterator categories provide stronger guarantees
than input iterator, because the result of the dereference operation is <tt>reference</tt>, and <strong>not</strong>
only convertible to the value type (The exact form from the SGI documentation does not correctly refer to
<tt>reference</tt>).
</p></li>
</ol>

<p><i>[2011-03-14: Daniel comments and updates the suggested wording]</i></p>


<p>In addition to the before mentioned necessary changes there is another one need, which
became obvious due to issue <a href="2042">2042</a>: <tt>forward_list&lt;&gt;::before_begin()</tt> returns
an iterator value which is not dereferencable, but obviously the intention is that it should
be incrementable. This leads to the conclusion that imposing dereferencable as a requirement
for the expressions <tt>++r</tt> is wrong: We only need the iterator to be incrementable. A
similar conclusion applies to the expression <tt>--r</tt> of bidirectional iterators.</p>

<p><i>[
2011 Bloomington
]</i></p>


<p>
Consensus this is the correct direction, but there are (potentially) missing <i>incrementable</i>
preconditions on some table rows, and the Remarks on when an output iterator becomes dereferencable
are probably better handled outside the table, in a manner similar to the way we word for input
iterators.
</p>

<p>
There was some concern about redundant pre-conditions when the operational semantic is defined in
terms of operations that have preconditions, and a similar level of concern over dropping such
redundancies vs. applying a consistent level of redundant specification in all the iterator tables.
Wording clean-up in either direction would be welcome.
</p>

<p><i>[2011-08-18: Daniel adapts the proposed resolution to honor the Bloomington request]</i></p>


<p>
There is only a small number of further changes suggested to get rid of superfluous 
requirements and essentially non-normative assertions. Operations should not have extra 
pre-conditions, if defined by "in-terms-of" semantics, see e.g. <tt>a != b</tt> or <tt>a-&gt;m</tt> 
for Table 107. Further, some remarks, that do not impose anything or say nothing new have been removed, 
because I could not find anything helpful they provide.
E.g. consider the remarks for Table 108 for the operations dereference-assignment and
preincrement: They don't provide additional information say nothing surprising. With the
new pre-conditions <em>and</em> post-conditions it is implied what the remarks intend to say.

<p>
The following sentence is dropped from the standard section on OutputIterators:
<p/>
"In particular, the following two conditions should hold: first, any
iterator value should be assigned through before it is incremented
(this is, for an output iterator <tt>i, i++; i++;</tt> is not a valid code
sequence); second, any value of an output iterator may have at most
one active copy at any given time (for example, <tt>i = j; *++i = a; *j = b;</tt> 
is not a valid code sequence)."
</p>

<p><i>[
2011-11-04: Daniel comments and improves the wording
]</i></p>


<p>
In regard to the first part of the comment, the intention of the newly proposed wording 
was to make clear that for the expression
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
*r = o
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
we have the precondition dereferenceable and the post-condition
incrementable. And for the expression
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
++r
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
we have the precondition incrementable and the post-condition dereferenceable 
or past-the-end. This <em>should not</em>  allow for a sequence like <tt>i++; i++;</tt> 
but I agree that it doesn't exactly say that.
<p/>
In regard to the second point: To make this point clearer, I suggest to
add a similar additional wording as we already have for input iterator to the 
"Assertion&#47;note" column of the expression <tt>++r</tt>:
<p/>
"Post: any copies of the previous value of <tt>r</tt> are no longer 
required to be dereferenceable or incrementable."

<p>In comp.lang.c++, Vicente Botet raises the following questions:</p>

<blockquote><p>
&quot;In "24.2.4 Output iterators" there are 3 uses of incrementable. I've
not found the definition. Could some one point me where it is defined?
<p/>
Something similar occurs with dereferenceable. While the definition is
given in "24.2.1 In general" it is used several times before.
<p/>
Shouldn't these definitions be moved to some previous section?&quot;
</p></blockquote>

<p>He's right: both terms are used without being properly defined.
<p/>
There is no definition of "incrementable".
<p/>
While there is a definition of "dereferenceable", it is, in fact, a definition of 
"dereferenceable iterator". "dereferenceable" is used throughout Clause 23 (Containers) 
before its definition in Clause 24. In almost all cases it's referring to iterators, 
but in 16.5.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/swappable.requirements">[swappable.requirements]</a> there is a mention of "dereferenceable object"; in 
16.5.3.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/allocator.requirements">[allocator.requirements]</a> the table of Descriptive variable definitions refers to a 
"dereferenceable pointer"; 20.10.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/pointer.traits.functions">[pointer.traits.functions]</a> refers to a 
"dereferenceable pointer"; in 28.4.5.1.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/locale.time.get.virtuals">[locale.time.get.virtuals]</a>&#47;11 (<tt>do_get</tt>) 
there is a requirement that a pointer "shall be dereferenceable". In those specific cases 
it is not defined.

<p>
The currently agreed on proposed wording for <a href="2015">2015</a> using 
<tt>remove_all_extents&lt;T&gt;::type</tt> instead of the "an array of 
unknown bound" terminology in the precondition should be extended to 
some further entries especially in Table 49, notably the 
<tt>is_*constructible</tt>, <tt>is_*assignable</tt>, and 
<tt>is_*destructible</tt> entries. To prevent ODR violations, incomplete
element types of arrays must be excluded for value-initialization and
destruction for example. Construction and assignment has to be honored, 
when we have array-to-pointer conversions or pointer conversions of
incomplete pointees in effect.
</p>

<p><i>[2012, Kona]</i></p>

<p>
The issue is that in three type traits, we are accidentally saying that in certain
circumstances the type must give a specified answer when given an incomplete type.
(Specifically: an array of unknown bound of incomplete type.)  The issue asserts
that there's an ODR violation, since the trait returns false in that case but might
return a different version when the trait is completed.
</p>
<p>
Howard argues: no, there is no risk of an ODR violation.
<tt>is_constructible&lt;A[]></tt> must return <tt>false</tt> regardless of whether
<tt>A</tt> is complete, so there's no reason to forbid an array of unknown bound of
incomplete types. Same argument applies to <tt>is_assignable</tt>. General agreement
with Howard's reasoning.
</p>
<p>
There may be a real issue for <tt>is_destructible</tt>. None of us are sure what
<tt>is_destructible</tt> is supposed to mean for an array of unknown bound
(regardless of whether its type is complete), and the standard doesn't make it clear.
The middle column doesn't say what it's supposed to do for incomplete types.
</p>
<p>
In at least one implementation, <tt>is_destructible&lt;A[]></tt> does return <tt>true</tt>
if <tt>A</tt> is complete, which would result in ODR violation unless we forbid it for
incomplete types.
</p>
<p>
Move to open. We believe there is no issue for <tt>is_constructible</tt> or
<tt>is_assignable</tt>, but that there is a real issue for <tt>is_destructible</tt>.

<p>
Andrzej Krzemienski reported the following on comp.std.c++:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In N3290, which is to become the official standard, in 17.9.4.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/terminate">[terminate]</a>,
paragraph 1 reads
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Remarks</i>: Called by the implementation when exception handling must
be abandoned for any of several reasons (15.5.1), in effect immediately after 
evaluating the <em>throw-expression</em> (18.8.3.1). May also be called directly by the 
program.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not clear what is "in effect". It was clear in previous drafts where paragraphs 
1 and 2 read:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Called by the implementation when exception handling must be
abandoned for any of several reasons (15.5.1). May also be called directly
by the program.
<p/>
<i>Effects</i>: Calls the <tt>terminate_handler</tt> function in effect
immediately after evaluating the <em>throw-expression</em> (18.8.3.1), if called by the
implementation, or calls the current <tt>terminate_handler</tt> function,
if called by the program.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It was changed by N3189. The same applies to function unexpected (D. 11.4, paragraph 1).
<p/>
Assuming the previous wording is still intended, the wording can be read
"unless <tt>std::terminate</tt> is called by the program, we will use the handler
that was in effect immediately after evaluating the throw-expression".
<p/>
  This assumes that there is some throw-expression connected to every
  situation that triggers the call to <tt>std::terminate</tt>. But this is not
  the case:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  In case <tt>std::thread</tt> is assigned to or destroyed while being joinable
  there is no throw-expression involved.
</li>
<li>
  In case <tt>std::unexpected</tt> is called by the program, <tt>std::terminate</tt> is
  triggered by the implementation - no throw-expression involved.
</li>
<li>
  In case a destructor throws during stack unwinding we have two throw-expressions 
  involved.
 </li>
 </ul>
<p>
Which one is referred to?
<p/>
In case <tt>std::nested_exception::rethrow_nested</tt> is called for an object that has 
captured no exception, there is no throw-expression involved directly (and may no throw 
be involved even indirectly).
<p/>
Next, 17.9.4.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/terminate.handler">[terminate.handler]</a>, paragraph 2 says 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Required behavior</i>: A <tt>terminate_handler</tt> shall terminate execution
of the program without returning to the caller.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This seems to allow that the function may exit by throwing an
exception (because word "return" implies a normal return).
<p/>
One could argue that words "terminate execution of the program" are sufficient,
but then why "without returning to the caller" would be mentioned. In
case such handler throws, noexcept specification in function <tt>std::terminate</tt> 
is violated, and <tt>std::terminate</tt> would be called recursively - should 
<tt>std::abort</tt> not be called in case of recursive <tt>std::terminate</tt> 
call? On the other hand some controlled recursion could be useful, like in the 
<a href="http://cplusplus.co.il/2010/03/21/catching-uncaught-exceptions-within-terminate/">following technique</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The here mentioned wording changes by N3189 in regard to 17.9.4.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/terminate">[terminate]</a> p1 
were done for a better separation of effects (Effects element) and additional normative 
wording explanations (Remarks element), there was no meaning change intended. Further,
there was already a defect existing in the previous wording, which was not updated when 
further situations where defined, when <tt>std::terminate</tt> where supposed to be 
called by the implementation. 
<p/>
The part
<p/>
"in effect immediately after evaluating the throw-expression"
<p/>
should be removed and the quoted reference to 17.9.4.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/terminate.handler">[terminate.handler]</a> 
need to be part of the effects element where it refers to the current <tt>terminate_handler</tt> 
function, so should be moved just after
<p/>
"Effects: Calls the current <tt>terminate_handler</tt> function."
<p/>
It seems ok to allow a termination handler to exit via an exception, but the 
suggested idiom should better be replaced by a more simpler one based on
evaluating the current exception pointer in the terminate handler, e.g.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void our_terminate (void) {
  std::exception_ptr p = std::current_exception();
  if (p) {
    ... // OK to rethrow and to determine it's nature
  } else {
    ... // Do something else
  }
}

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
When the <tt>EmplaceConstructible</tt> (22.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a>&#47;13) requirement is used 
to initialize an object, direct-initialization occurs. Initializing an aggregate or using a <tt>std::initializer_list</tt> 
constructor with emplace requires naming the initialized type and moving a temporary. This is a result of 
<tt>std::allocator::construct</tt> using direct-initialization, not list-initialization (sometimes called "uniform 
initialization") syntax.
<p/>
Altering <tt>std::allocator&lt;T&gt;::construct</tt> to use list-initialization would, among other things, give 
preference to <tt>std::initializer_list</tt> constructor overloads, breaking valid code in an unintuitive and 
unfixable way &mdash; there would be no way for <tt>emplace_back</tt> to access a constructor preempted by 
<tt>std::initializer_list</tt> without essentially reimplementing <tt>push_back</tt>.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; v;
v.emplace_back(3, 4); // v[0] == {4, 4, 4}, not {3, 4} as in list-initialization
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The proposed compromise is to use SFINAE with <tt>std::is_constructible</tt>, which tests whether direct-initialization 
is well formed. If <tt>is_constructible</tt> is false, then an alternative <tt>std::allocator::construct</tt> overload 
is chosen which uses list-initialization. Since list-initialization always falls back on direct-initialization, the 
user will see diagnostic messages as if list-initialization (uniform-initialization) were always being used, because 
the direct-initialization overload cannot fail.
<p/>
I can see two corner cases that expose gaps in this scheme. One occurs when arguments intended for 
<tt>std::initializer_list</tt> satisfy a constructor, such as trying to emplace-insert a value of <tt>{3, 4}</tt> in 
the above example. The workaround is to explicitly specify the <tt>std::initializer_list</tt> type, as in 
<tt>v.emplace_back(std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt;(3, 4))</tt>. Since this matches the semantics as if 
<tt>std::initializer_list</tt> were deduced, there seems to be no real problem here.
<p/>
The other case is when arguments intended for aggregate initialization satisfy a constructor. Since aggregates cannot 
have user-defined constructors, this requires that the first nonstatic data member of the aggregate be implicitly 
convertible from the aggregate type, and that the initializer list have one element. The workaround is to supply an 
initializer for the second member. It remains impossible to in-place construct an aggregate with only one nonstatic 
data member by conversion from a type convertible to the aggregate's own type. This seems like an acceptably small 
hole.
<p/>
The change is quite small because <tt>EmplaceConstructible</tt> is defined in terms of whatever allocator is specified, 
and there is no need to explicitly mention SFINAE in the normative text.

<p>
There appears to be a real concern with initializing aggregates, that can be performed only
using brace-initialization.  There is little interest in the rest of the issue, given the existence
of 'emplace' methods in C++11.
</p>
<p>
Move to Open, to find an acceptable solution for intializing aggregates.  There is the potential
that EWG may have an interest in this area of language consistency as well.

<p>
As of 16.5.3.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/utility.arg.requirements">[utility.arg.requirements]</a> Table 17&#47;18, the return types of the expressions
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
a == b
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
or
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
a &lt; b
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
for types satisfying the <tt>EqualityComparable</tt> or <tt>LessThanComparable</tt>
types, respectively, are required to be "convertible to <tt>bool</tt>" which corresponds to
a copy-initialization context. But several newer parts of the library that refer to 
such contexts have lowered the requirements taking  advantage of the new terminology of 
"<em>contextually</em> convertible to <tt>bool</tt>" instead, which corresponds to a 
direct-initialization context (In addition to "normal" direct-initialization constructions, 
operands of logical operations as well as <tt>if</tt> or <tt>switch</tt> conditions also 
belong to this special context).
<p/>
One example for these new requirements are input iterators which satisfy <tt>EqualityComparable</tt> 
but also specify that the expression
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
a != b
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
shall be just "<strong>contextually</strong> convertible to <tt>bool</tt>". The same discrepancy 
exists for requirement set <tt>NullablePointer</tt> in regard to several equality-related expressions.
<p/>
For random access iterators we have
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<tt>a &lt; b</tt>      contextually convertible to <tt>bool</tt>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
as well as for all derived comparison functions, so strictly speaking we could have a random access 
iterator that does not satisfy the <tt>LessThanComparable</tt> requirements, which looks like an
artifact to me.
<p/>
Even if we keep with the existing requirements based on <tt>LessThanComparable</tt> or
<tt>EqualityComparable</tt> we still would have the problem that some current specifications 
are actually  based on the assumption of implicit convertibility instead of "explicit convertibility", e.g. 
20.11.1.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unique.ptr.special">[unique.ptr.special]</a> p3:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class T1, class D1, class T2, class D2&gt;
bool operator!=(const unique_ptr&lt;T1, D1&gt;&amp; x, const unique_ptr&lt;T2, D2&gt;&amp; y);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-3- <i>Returns</i>: <tt>x.get() != y.get()</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
Similar examples exist in 20.11.1.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unique.ptr.single.dtor">[unique.ptr.single.dtor]</a> p2, 20.11.1.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unique.ptr.single.asgn">[unique.ptr.single.asgn]</a> p9,
20.11.1.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unique.ptr.single.observers">[unique.ptr.single.observers]</a> p1+3+8, etc.
<p/>
In all these places the expressions involving comparison functions (but <em>not</em> those of the conversion 
of a <tt>NullablePointer</tt> to <tt>bool</tt>!) assume to be "convertible to <tt>bool</tt>". I think this
is a very natural assumption and all delegations of the comparison functions of some type <tt>X</tt> to some
other API type <tt>Y</tt> in third-party code does so assuming that copy-initialization semantics will
just work.
<p/>
The actual reason for using the newer terminology can be rooted back to LWG <a href="556">556</a>. My hypotheses 
is that the resolution of that issue also needs a slight correction. Why so?
<p/>
The reason for opening that issue were worries based on the previous "convertible to <tt>bool</tt>"
wording. An expressions like "<tt>!pred(a, b)</tt>" might not be well-formed in those situations, because
<tt>operator!</tt> might not be accessible or might have an unusual semantics (and similarly for other logical
operations). This can indeed happen with unusual proxy return types, so the idea was that the evaluation of 
<tt>Predicate</tt>, <tt>BinaryPredicate</tt> (25.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/algorithms.general">[algorithms.general]</a> p8+9), and <tt>Compare</tt> 
(25.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/alg.sorting">[alg.sorting]</a> p2) should be defined based on contextual conversion to <tt>bool</tt>. 
Unfortunately this <em>alone</em> is not sufficient: In addition, I think, we <em>also</em> want the predicates 
to be (implicitly) convertible to <tt>bool</tt>! Without this wording, several conditions are plain wrong, 
e.g. 25.5.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/alg.find">[alg.find]</a> p2, which talks about "<tt>pred(*i) != false</tt>" (<tt>find_if</tt>) and 
"<tt>pred(*i) == false</tt>" (<tt>find_if_not</tt>). These expressions are not within a boolean context! 
<p/>
While we could simply fix all these places by proper wording to be considered in a "contextual conversion to
<tt>bool</tt>", I think that this is not the correct solution: Many third-party libraries already refer to
the previous C++03 <tt>Predicate</tt> definition &mdash; it actually predates C++98 and is as old as the 
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Predicate.html">SGI specification</a>. It seems to be a high price to
pay to switch to direct initialization here instead of fixing a completely different specification problem.
<p/>
A final observation is that we have another definition for a <tt>Predicate</tt> in 32.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.req.paramname">[thread.req.paramname]</a> p2:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If a parameter is <tt>Predicate</tt>, <tt>operator()</tt> applied to the actual template argument shall return a value that
is convertible to <tt>bool</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The problem here is not that we have two different definitions of <tt>Predicate</tt> in the standard &mdash; this 
is confusing, but this fact alone is not a defect. The first (minor) problem is that this definition does not properly 
apply to function objects that are function pointers, because <tt>operator()</tt> is not defined in a strict sense. 
But the actually worse second problem is that this wording has the very <tt>same</tt> problem that has originally lead to
LWG <a href="556">556</a>! We only need to look at 32.5.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.condition.condvar">[thread.condition.condvar]</a> p15 to recognice this:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
while (!pred())
  wait(lock);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The negation expression here looks very familiar to the example provided in LWG <a href="556">556</a> and is sensitive
to the same "unusual proxy" problem. Changing the 32.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.req.paramname">[thread.req.paramname]</a> wording to a corresponding
"contextual conversion to <tt>bool</tt>" wouldn't work either, because existing specifications rely on "convertible
to <tt>bool</tt>", e.g. 32.5.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.condition.condvar">[thread.condition.condvar]</a> p32+33+42 or 32.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.condition.condvarany">[thread.condition.condvarany]</a> 
p25+26+32+33.
<p/>
To summarize: I believe that LWG <a href="556">556</a> was not completely resolved. A pessimistic interpretation is,
that even with the current wording based on "contextually convertible to <tt>bool</tt>" the actual problem of that 
issue has <em>not</em> been fixed. What actually needs to be required here is some normative wording that basically
expresses something along the lines of:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The semantics of <em>any</em> contextual conversion to <tt>bool</tt> shall be equivalent to the semantics of 
any implicit conversion to <tt>bool</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is still not complete without having concepts, but it seems to be a better approximation. Another way of solving
this issue would be to define a minimum requirements table with equivalent semantics. The proposed wording is a bit
simpler but attempts to express the same thing.

<p><i>[2012-10-12, STL comments]</i></p>


<ol>
<li>
<p>
The current proposed resolution still isn't completely satisfying. It would certainly be possible for the Standard to 
require these various expressions to be implicitly and contextually convertible to <tt>bool</tt>, but that would have 
a subtle consequence (which, I will argue, is undesirable - regardless of the fact that it dates all the way back to 
C++98/03). It would allow users to provide really wacky types to the Standard Library, with one of two effects:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
<li>
<p>Standard Library implementations would have to go to great lengths to respect such wacky types, essentially using 
<tt>static_cast&lt;bool&gt;</tt> when invoking any predicates or comparators.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Otherwise, such wacky types would be de facto nonportable, because they would make Standard Library implementations 
explode.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Effect B is the status quo we're living with today. What Standard Library implementations want to do with <tt>pred(args)</tt> 
goes beyond "<tt>if (pred(args))</tt>" (C++03), contextually converting <tt>pred(args)</tt> to <tt>bool</tt> (C++11), or 
implicitly and contextually converting <tt>pred(args)</tt> to <tt>bool</tt> (the current proposed resolution). 
Implementations want to say things like:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
if (pred(args))
if (!pred(args))
if (cond &amp;&amp; pred(args))
if (cond &amp;&amp; !pred(args))
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
These are real examples taken from Dinkumware's implementation. There are others that would be realistic 
("<tt>pred(args) &amp;&amp; cond</tt>", "<tt>cond || pred(args)</tt>", etc.)
<p/>
Although negation was mentioned in this issue's Discussion section, and in LWG <a href="556">556</a>'s, the current proposed 
resolution doesn't fix this problem. Requiring <tt>pred(args)</tt> to be implicitly and contextually convertible to <tt>bool</tt> 
doesn't prevent <tt>operator!()</tt> from being overloaded and returning <tt>std::string</tt> (as a wacky example). More 
ominously, it doesn't prevent <tt>operator&amp;&amp;()</tt> and <tt>operator||()</tt> from being overloaded and destroying 
short-circuiting.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
I would like LWG input before working on Standardese for a new proposed resolution. Here's an outline of what I'd like to 
do:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
<li>
<p>
Introduce a new "concept" in 16.5.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/utility.requirements">[utility.requirements]</a>, which I would call <tt>BooleanTestable</tt> in the 
absence of better ideas.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Centralize things and reduce verbosity by having everything simply refer to <tt>BooleanTestable</tt> when necessary. 
I believe that the tables could say "Return type: <tt>BooleanTestable</tt>", while Predicate/BinaryPredicate/Compare 
would need the incantation "shall satisfy the requirements of BooleanTestable".
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Resolve the tug-of-war between users (who occasionally want to do weird things) and implementers (who don't want to have 
to contort their code) by requiring that:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">
<li>
<p>
Given a <tt>BooleanTestable x</tt>, <tt>x</tt> is both implicitly and contextually convertible to <tt>bool</tt>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Given a <tt>BooleanTestable x</tt>, <tt>!x</tt> is <tt>BooleanTestable</tt>. (This is intentionally "recursive".)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Given a <tt>BooleanTestable x</tt>, <tt>bool t = x, t2(x), f = !x;</tt> has the postcondition <tt>t == t2 &amp;&amp; t != f</tt>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Given a <tt>BooleanTestable x</tt> and a <tt>BooleanTestable y</tt> of possibly different types, "<tt>x &amp;&amp; y</tt>" 
and "<tt>x || y</tt>" invoke the built-in <tt>operator&amp;&amp;()</tt> and <tt>operator||()</tt>, triggering short-circuiting.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<tt>bool</tt> is <tt>BooleanTestable</tt>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

</li>

</ol>

<p>
 I believe that this simultaneously gives users great latitude to use types other than <tt>bool</tt>, while allowing 
 implementers to write reasonable code in order to get their jobs done. (If I'm forgetting anything that implementers 
 would want to say, please let me know.)
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
About requirement (I): As Daniel patiently explained to me, we need to talk about both implicit conversions and 
contextual conversions, because it's possible for a devious type to have both "<tt>explicit operator bool()</tt>" 
and "<tt>operator int()</tt>", which might behave differently (or be deleted, etc.).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
About requirement (IV): This is kind of tricky. What we'd like to say is, "<tt>BooleanTestable</tt> can't ever trigger 
an overloaded logical operator". However, given a perfectly reasonable type <tt>Nice</tt> - perhaps even <tt>bool</tt> itself! - 
other code (perhaps a third-party library) could overload <tt>operator&amp;&amp;(Nice, Evil)</tt>. Therefore, I believe 
that the requirement should be "no first use" - the Standard Library will ask for various <tt>BooleanTestable</tt> types 
from users (for example, the result of "<tt>first != last</tt>" and the result of "<tt>pred(args)</tt>"), and as long 
as they don't trigger overloaded logical operators with each other, everything is awesome.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
About requirement (V): This is possibly redundant, but it's trivial to specify, makes it easier for users to understand 
what they need to do ("oh, I can always achieve this with <tt>bool</tt>"), and provides a "base case" for requirement 
(IV) that may or may not be necessary.  Since <tt>bool</tt> is <tt>BooleanTestable</tt>, overloading 
<tt>operator&amp;&amp;(bool, Other)</tt> (etc.) clearly makes the <tt>Other</tt> type non-<tt>BooleanTestable</tt>.
</p>
</li>

<p><i>[2014-05-20, Daniel suggests concrete wording based on STL's proposal]</i></p>

<p>
The presented wording follows relatively closely STL's outline with the following notable exceptions:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
<li><p>
A reference to <tt>BooleanTestable</tt> in table "Return Type" specifications seemed very unusual to me and
I found no "prior art" for this in the Standard. Instead I decided to follow the usual style to add a symbol
with a specific meaning to a specific paragraph that specifies symbols and their meanings.
</p></li>
<li><p>
STL's requirement IV suggested to directly refer to built-in operators <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt> and <tt>||</tt>. In my
opinion this concrete requirement isn't needed if we simply require that two <tt>BooleanTestable</tt> operands behave 
equivalently to two those operands after conversion to <tt>bool</tt> (each of them).
</p></li>
<li><p>
I couldn't find a good reason to require normatively that type <tt>bool</tt> meets the requirements of <tt>BooleanTestable</tt>: My
assertion is that after having defined them, the result simply falls out of this. But to make this a bit clearer, I added
also a non-normative note to these effects.
</p></li>

Alisdair: Should specify we don't break short circuiting.<br/>
Ville: Looks already specified because that's the way it works for bool. <br/>

B2/P2 is somewhat ambiguous. It implies that B has to be both implicitly convertible to bool and contextually convertible to bool.<br/>

<p>
To satisfy the Kona 2015 committee comments, the wording in 
[booleantestable.requirements] has been improved to better separate the two different requirements of "can be 
contextually converted to <tt>bool</tt>" and "can be implicitly converted to <tt>bool</tt>. Both are necessary because 
it is possible to define a type that has the latter property but not the former, such as the following one:

<h3><a name="2115" href="2115">2115.</a> Undefined behaviour for <tt>valarray</tt> assignments with <tt>mask_array</tt> index?</h3>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
Recently I received a Service Request (SR) alleging that one of our testcases causes an 
undefined behavior. The complaint is that 26.7.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/template.mask.array">[template.mask.array]</a> in C++11 
(and the corresponding subclause in C++03) are interpreted by some people to require that 
in an assignment "<tt>a[mask] = b</tt>", the subscript <tt>mask</tt> and the rhs <tt>b</tt> 
must have the same number of elements.
<p/>
IMHO, if that is the intended requirement, it should be stated explicitly.
<p/>
In any event, there is a tiny editorial cleanup that could be made:
<p/>
In C++11, 26.7.8.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/template.mask.array.overview">[template.mask.array.overview]</a> para 2 mentions
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"the expression <tt>a[mask] = b;</tt>"
</p></blockquote>
<p>
but the semicolon cannot be part of an expression. The correction could omit the 
semicolon, or change the word "expression" to "assignment" or "statement".
<p/>
Here is the text of the SR, slightly modified for publication:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Subject:  SR01174 LVS _26322Y31 has undefined behavior [open]
<p/>
[Client:]<br/>
The test case t263.dir&#47;_26322Y31.cpp seems to be illegal as it has an undefined 
behaviour. I searched into the SRs but found SRs were not related to the topic 
explained in this mail (SR00324, SR00595, SR00838).
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
const char vl[] = {"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"};
const char vu[] = {"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"};
const std::valarray&lt;char&gt; v0(vl, 27), vm5(vu, 5), vm6(vu, 6);
std::valarray&lt;char&gt; x = v0;
[&hellip;]
const bool vb[] = {false, false, true, true, false, true};
const std::valarray&lt;bool&gt; vmask(vb, 6);
x = v0;

This problem has already been discussed between [experts]:
See thread <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/2009-11/threads.html#00051">http:&#47;&#47;gcc.gnu.org&#47;ml&#47;libstdc++&#47;2009-11&#47;threads.html#00051</a>

<p/>
[Plum Hall:]<br/>
Before I log this as an SR, I need to check one detail with you.
<p/>
I did read the email thread you mentioned, and I did find a citation (see INCITS ISO&#47;IEC 14882-2003 
Section 26.3.2.6 on valarray computed assignments):
<p/>
Quote: "If the array and the argument array do not have the same length, the behavior is undefined",
<p/>
But this applies to computed assignment (<tt>*=</tt>, <tt>+=</tt>, etc), not to simple assignment. Here is the C++03 citation 
re simple assignment:
<p/>
26.3.2.2 valarray assignment [lib.valarray.assign]
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
valarray&lt;T&gt;&amp; operator=(const valarray&lt;T&gt;&amp;);
</pre><blockquote>
<p>
1 Each element of the <tt>*this</tt> array is assigned the value of the corresponding element of the argument array.
The resulting behavior is undefined if the length of the argument array is not equal to the length of the
<tt>*this</tt> array.
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
In the new C++11 (N3291), we find ...
<p/>
26.6.2.3 valarray assignment [valarray.assign]
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
valarray&lt;T&gt;&amp; operator=(const valarray&lt;T&gt;&amp; v);
</pre><blockquote>
<p>
1 Each element of the <tt>*this</tt> array is assigned the value of the corresponding element of the argument
array. If the length of <tt>v</tt> is not equal to the length of <tt>*this</tt>, resizes <tt>*this</tt> to make 
the two arrays the same length, as if by calling <tt>resize(v.size())</tt>, before performing the assignment.
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
So it looks like the testcase might be valid for C++11 but not for C++03; what do you think?
<p/>
[Client:]<br/>
I quite agree with you but the two problems I mentioned:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
x[vmask] = vm5;      // ***** HERE....
[&hellip;]
x2 = x[vmask];       // ***** ....AND HERE
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
refer to <tt>mask_array</tt> assignment hence target the C++03 26.3.8 paragraph. Correct?
<p/>
[Plum Hall:]<br/>
I mentioned the contrast between C++03 26.3.2.2 para 1 versus C++11 26.6.2.3 para 1.
<p/>
But in C++03 26.3.8, I don't find any corresponding restriction. Could you quote the specific 
requirement you're writing about?
<p/>
[Client:]<br/>
I do notice the difference between c++03 26.3.2.2 and c++11 26.6.2.3 about assignments between 
different sized <tt>valarray</tt> and I perfectly agree with you.
<p/>
But, as already stated, this is not a simple <tt>valarray</tt> assignment but a
<tt>mask_array</tt> assignment (c++03 26.3.8 &#47; c++11 26.6.8). See c++11 quote below:
<p/>
26.6.8 Class template mask_array<br/>
26.6.8.1 Class template mask_array overview<br/>
[....]
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>This template is a helper template used by the mask subscript operator:
<tt>mask_array&lt;T&gt; valarray&lt;T&gt;::operator[](const valarray&lt;bool&gt;&amp;)</tt>.
</p></li>
<li><p>It has reference semantics to a subset of an array specified by a boolean mask. Thus, 
the expression <tt>a[mask] = b;</tt> has the effect of assigning <em>the elements of <tt>b</tt></em> 
to the masked elements in <tt>a</tt> (those for which the corresponding element in <tt>mask</tt> is true.)
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
26.6.8.2 mask_array assignment
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void operator=(const valarray&lt;T&gt;&amp;) const;
const mask_array&amp; operator=(const mask_array&amp;) const;
</pre><blockquote>
<p>
1 These assignment operators have reference semantics, assigning the values of the argument array 
elements to selected elements of the <tt>valarray&lt;T&gt;</tt> object to which it refers.
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
In particular, [one of the WG21 experts] insisted on the piece "the elements of <tt>b</tt>".
<p/>
That is why I reported the test t263.dir&#47;_26322Y31.cpp having an undefined behaviour.
<p/>
[Plum Hall:]<br/>
OK, I can see that I will have to ask WG21; I will file an appropriate issue 
with the Library subgroup. In the meantime, I will mark this testcase as "DISPUTED" 
so that it is not required for conformance testing, until we get a definitive opinion.

Moved to Open.
</p>
<p>
There appears to be a real need for clarification in the standard, and
implementations differ in their current interpretation.  This will need
some research by implementers and a proposed resolution before further
discussion is likely to be fruitful.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
IMO if we specified <tt>is_[nothrow_]constructible</tt> in terms of a variable
declaration whose validity requires destructibility, it is clearly a bug
in our specification and a failure to realize the actual original
intent. The specification should have been in terms of placement-new.
<p/>
Daniel:<br/>
At the time of the specification this was intended and the solution is
<em>not</em> done by removing the destruction semantics of <tt>is_constructible</tt>.
<p/>
The design of <tt>is_constructible</tt> was also impacted by the previous
<tt>Constructible</tt> concept that <em>explicitly</em> contained destruction semantics,
because during conceptification of the library it turned out to simplify
the constraints  in the library because you did not need to add
<tt>Destructible</tt> all the time. It often was implied but never spoken out
in C++03.
<p/>
Pure construction semantics was considered as useful as well, so <tt>HasConstructor</tt>
did also exist and would surely be useful as trait as well.
<p/>
Another example that is often overlooked: This also affects wrapper types like <tt>pair</tt>,
<tt>tuple</tt>, <tt>array</tt> that contain potentially more than one type:
This is easy to understand if you think of <tt>T1</tt> having a deleted destructor
and <tt>T2</tt> having a constructor that may throw: Obviously the compiler has
potentially need to use the <tt>destructor</tt> of <tt>T1</tt> in the <em>constructor</em>
of <tt>std::pair&lt;T1, T2&gt;</tt> to ensure that the core language requirements
are satisfied (All previous fully constructed sub-objects must be destructed).
<p/>
The core language also honors this fact in  [class.copy] p11:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
A defaulted copy&#47;move constructor for a class <tt>X</tt> is defined as deleted (9.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/dcl.fct.def.delete">[dcl.fct.def.delete]</a>)
if <tt>X</tt> has:<br/>
[&hellip;]<br/>
&mdash; any direct or virtual base class or non-static data member of a type with a destructor that is deleted
or inaccessible from the defaulted constructor,<br/>
[&hellip;]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Dave:<br/>
This is about <tt>is_nothrow_constructible</tt> in particular. The fact that it is
foiled by not having a <tt>noexcept</tt> dtor is a defect.

</p>
<p>
<tt>is_nothrow_constructible</tt> is defined in terms of <tt>is_constructible</tt>, which is defined
by looking at a hypothetical variable and asking whether the variable definition is known not to
throw exceptions. The issue claims that this also examines the type's destructor, given the context,
and thus will return <tt>false</tt> if the destructor can potentially throw. At least one
implementation (Howard's) does return <tt>false</tt> if the constructor is <tt>noexcept(true)</tt>
and the destructor is <tt>noexcept(false)</tt>. So that's not a strained interpretation.
The issue is asking for this to be defined in terms of placement <tt>new</tt>, instead of in terms
of a temporary object, to make it clearer that <tt>is_nothrow_constructible</tt> looks at the
<tt>noexcept</tt> status of only the constructor, and not the destructor.
</p>
<p>
Sketch of what the wording would look like:
</p>
<p>
require <tt>is_constructible</tt>, and then also require that a placement <tt>new</tt> operation
does not throw. (Remembering the title of this issue... What does this imply for <tt>swap</tt>?
</p>
<p>
If we accept this resolution, do we need any changes to <tt>swap</tt>?
</p>
<p> STL argues: no, because you are already forbidden from passing anything with a throwing
destructor to <tt>swap</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Dietmar argues: no, not true. Maybe statically the destructor can conceivably throw for some
values, but maybe there are some values known not to throw. In that case, it's correct to
pass those values to <tt>swap</tt>.

<p>
Iostreams should include a manipulator to toggle grouping on&#47;off for
locales that support grouped digits. This has come up repeatedly and
been deferred. See LWG <a href="826">826</a> for the previous attempt.
<p/>
If one is using a locale that supports grouped digits, then output
will always include the generated grouping characters. However, very
plausible scenarios exist where one might want to output the number,
un-grouped. This is similar to existing manipulators that toggle
on&#47;off the decimal point, numeric base, or positive sign.

<p>
The front matter in clause 17 should clarify that postconditions will not hold if a 
standard library function exits via an exception. Postconditions or guarantees that 
apply when an exception is thrown (beyond the basic guarantee) are described in an 
"Exception safety" section.
</p>

<p><i>[

]</i></p>


<p>
Consensus that we do not clearly say this, and that we probably should.  A likely
location to describe the guarantees of <i>postconditions</i> could well be a new
sub-clause following 16.5.4.11 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/res.on.required">[res.on.required]</a> which serves the same purpose
for <i>requires</i> clauses.  However, we need such wording before we can make
progress.

both issues together.

<p>
Sub-clause 16.5.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/swappable.requirements">[swappable.requirements]</a> defines two notions of swappability: a binary version defining
when two objects are <em>swappable with</em> one another, and a unary notion defining whether an object is 
<em>swappable</em> (without qualification), with the latter definition requiring that the object satisfy the 
former with respect to all values of the same type.
<p/>
Let <tt>T</tt> be a container type based on a non-propagating allocator whose instances do not necessarily 
compare equal. Then sub-clause 22.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a> p7 implies that no object <tt>t</tt> 
of type <tt>T</tt> is swappable (by the unary definition).
<p/>
Throughout the standard it is the unary definition of "swappable" that is listed as a requirement (with the 
exceptions of 20.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/utility.swap">[utility.swap]</a> p4, 20.4.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/pairs.pair">[pairs.pair]</a> p31, 20.5.3.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/tuple.swap">[tuple.swap]</a> p2, 
25.6.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/alg.swap">[alg.swap]</a> p2, and 25.6.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/alg.swap">[alg.swap]</a> p6, which use the binary definition). This renders 
many of the mutating sequence algorithms of sub-clause 25.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/alg.modifying.operations">[alg.modifying.operations]</a>, for example, 
inapplicable to sequences of standard container types, even where every element of the sequence is swappable 
with every other.
<p/>
Note that this concern extends beyond standard containers to all future allocator-based types.
<p/>
Resolution proposal:
<p/>
I see two distinct straightforward solutions:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
<li>Modify the requirements of algorithms from sub-clause 25.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/alg.modifying.operations">[alg.modifying.operations]</a>, and all other
places that reference the unary "swappable" definition, to instead use the binary "swappable with" definition 
(over a domain appropriate to the context). The unary definition of "swappable" could then be removed from the 
standard.
</li>
<li>Modify sub-clause 22.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a> such that objects of standard container types 
are "swappable" by the unary definition.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I favor the latter solution, for reasons detailed in the following issue.
</p>

<p><i>[
2012-10 Portland: Move to Open 
]</i></p>


<p>
The issue is broader than containers with stateful allocotors, although they are the most obvious
example contained within the standard itself.  The basic problem is that once you have a stateful
allocator, that does not <tt>propagate_on_swap</tt>, then whether two objects of this type can be
swapped with well defined behavior is a run-time property (the allocators compare equal) rather
than a simple compile-time property that can be deduced from the type.  Strictly speaking, any
type where the nature of swap is a runtime property does not meet the <tt>swappable</tt>
requirements of C++11, although typical sequences of such types are going to have elements that
are all <tt>swappable with</tt> any other element in the sequence (using our other term of art
for specifying requirements) as the common case is a container of elements who all share the
same allocator.
</p>

<p>
The heart of the problem is that the <tt>swappable</tt> requirments demand that any two objects
of the same type be <tt>swappable with</tt> each other, so if any two such objects would not
be <tt>swappable with</tt> each other, then the whole type is never <tt>swappable</tt>.  Many
algorithms in clause 25 are specified in terms of <tt>swappable</tt> which is essentially an
overspecification as all they actually need is that any element in the sequence is <tt>swappable
with</tt> any other element in the sequence.
</p>

<p>
At this point Howard joins the discussion and points out that the intent of introducing the
two swap-related terms was to support <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;::reference</tt> types, and we are
reading something into the wording that was never intended.  Consuses is that regardless of
the intent, that is what the words today say.
</p>

<p>
There is some support to see a paper reviewing the whole of clause 25 for this issue, and
other select clauses as may be necessary.
</p>

<p>
There was some consideration to introducing a note into the front of clause 25 to indicate
<tt>swappable</tt> requirements in the clause should be interpreted to allow such awkward
types, but ultimately no real enthusiasm for introducing a <tt>swappable for clause 25</tt>
requirement term, especially if it confusingly had the same name as a term used with a
subtly different meaning through the rest of the standard.
</p>

<p>
There was no enthusiasm for the alternate resolution of requiring containers with unequal
allocators that do not propagate provide a well-defined swap behavior, as it is not
believed to be possible without giving <tt>swap</tt> linear complexity for such values,
and even then would require adding the constraint that the container element types are
CopyConstructible.
</p>

<p>
Final conclusion: move to open pending a paper from a party with a strong interest in
stateful allocators.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Sub-clause 20.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/utility.swap">[utility.swap]</a> defines a non-member 'swap' function with defined behavior for
all <tt>MoveConstructible</tt> and <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> types. It does not guarantee
constant-time complexity or <tt>noexcept</tt> in general, however this definition does
render all objects of <tt>MoveConstructible</tt> and <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> type swappable
(by the unary definition of sub-clause 16.5.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/swappable.requirements">[swappable.requirements]</a>) in the absence of 
specializations or overloads.
<p/>
The overload of the non-member <tt>swap</tt> function defined in Table 96, however,
defines semantics incompatible with the generic non-member <tt>swap</tt> function,
since it is defined to call a member <tt>swap</tt> function whose semantics are
undefined for some values of <tt>MoveConstructible</tt> and <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> types.
<p/>
The obvious (perhaps naive) interpretation of sub-clause 16.5.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/swappable.requirements">[swappable.requirements]</a> is as a guide to
the "right" semantics to provide for a non-member <tt>swap</tt> function (called in
the context defined by 16.5.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/swappable.requirements">[swappable.requirements]</a> p3) in order to provide interoperable
user-defined types for generic programming. The standard container types don't follow these guidelines.
<p/>
More generally, the design in the standard represents a classic example of "contract narrowing". It 
is entirely reasonable for the contract of a particular <tt>swap</tt> overload to provide <em>more</em> 
guarantees, such as constant-time execution and <tt>noexcept</tt>, than are provided by the <tt>swap</tt> 
that is provided for any <tt>MoveConstructible</tt> and <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> types, but it is <em>not</em> 
reasonable for such an overload to fail to live up to the guarantees it provides for general types when 
it is applied to more specific types. Such an overload or specialization in generic programming is akin 
to an override of an inherited virtual function in OO programming: violating a superclass contract in a
subclass may be legal from the point of view of the language, but it is poor design and can easily lead 
to errors. While we cannot prevent user code from providing overloads that violate the more general 
<tt>swap</tt> contract, we can avoid doing so within the library itself.
<p/>
My proposed resolution is to draw a sharp distinction between member <tt>swap</tt> functions, which provide 
optimal performance but idiosyncratic contracts, and non-member <tt>swap</tt> functions, which should always 
fulfill at least the contract of 20.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/utility.swap">[utility.swap]</a> and thus render objects swappable. The member 
<tt>swap</tt> for containers with non-propagating allocators, for example, would offer constant-time
guarantees and <tt>noexcept</tt> but would only offer defined behavior for values with allocators that compare 
equal; non-member <tt>swap</tt> would test allocator equality and then dispatch to either member <tt>swap</tt> or 
<tt>std::swap</tt> depending on the result, providing defined behavior for all values (and rendering the type
"swappable"), but offering neither the constant-time nor the <tt>noexcept</tt> guarantees.

<p>
Objects of <tt>std::array&lt;T,N&gt;</tt> are supposed to be initialized with aggregate initialization (when 
not the destination of a copy or move). This clearly works when <tt>N</tt> is positive. What happens when <tt>N</tt> 
is zero?  To continue using an (inner) set of braces for initialization, a <tt>std::array&lt;T,0&gt;</tt> implementation 
must have an array member of at least one element, and let default initialization take care of those secret elements.  
This cannot work when <tt>T</tt> has a set of constructors and the default constructor is deleted from that set.
Solution: Add a new paragraph in 22.3.7.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/array.zero">[array.zero]</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The unspecified internal structure of array for this case shall allow initializations like:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
array&lt;T, 0&gt; a = { };
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
and said initializations must be valid even when <tt>T</tt> is not default-constructible.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>[2012, Portland: Move to Open]</i></p>

<p>
Some discussion to understand the issue, which is that implementations currently have freedom to implement
an empty <tt>array</tt> by holding a dummy element, and so might not support value initialization, which is
surprising when trying to construct an empty container.  However, this is not mandated, it is an unspecified
implementation detail.
</p>

<p>
Jeffrey points out that the implication of 22.3.7.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/array.overview">[array.overview]</a> is that this initialization syntax
must be supported by empty <tt>array</tt> objects already.  This is a surprising inference that was not
obvious to the room, but consensus is that the reading is accurate, so the proposed resolution is not necessary,
although the increased clarity may be useful.
</p>

<p>
Further observation is that the same clause effectively implies that <tt>T</tt> must always be DefaultConstructible,
regardless of <tt>N</tt> for the same reasons - as an <i>initializer-list</i> may not supply enough values, and the
remaining elements must all be value initialized.
</p>

<p>
Concern that we are dancing angels on the head of pin, and that relying on such subtle implications in wording is
not helpful. We need a clarification of the text in this area, and await wording.
</p>

<p><i>[2015-02 Cologne]</i></p>

<p>
DK: What was the outcome of Portland? AM: Initially we thought we already had the intended behaviour. 
We concluded that <tt>T</tt> must always be <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>, but I'm not sure why. GR: It's p2 in 
<tt>std::array</tt>, "up to <tt>N</tt>". AM: That wording already implies that "<tt>{}</tt>" has to work when <tt>N</tt> 
is zero. But the wording of p2 needs to be fixed to make clear that it does <em>not</em> imply that <tt>T</tt> must be 
<tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>.
<p/>
Conclusion: Update wording, revisit later.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
There are various operations on <tt>std::vector</tt> that can cause elements of the vector to be 
moved from one location to another. A move operation can use either rvalue or const lvalue as 
argument; the choice depends on the value of <tt>!is_nothrow_move_constructible&lt;T&gt;::value &amp;&amp;
is_copy_constructible&lt;T&gt;::value</tt>, where <tt>T</tt> is the element type. Thus, some operations 
on <tt>std::vector</tt> (e.g. 'resize' with single parameter, 'reserve', 'emplace_back') should have 
conditional requirements. For example, let's consider the requirement for 'reserve' in N3376 &ndash; 
22.3.11.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/vector.capacity">[vector.capacity]</a>&#47;2:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires</i>: <tt>T</tt> shall be <tt>MoveInsertable</tt> into <tt>*this</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This requirement is not sufficient if an implementation is free to select copy constructor when 
<tt>!is_nothrow_move_constructible&lt;T&gt;::value &amp;&amp; is_copy_constructible&lt;T&gt;::value</tt> 
evaluates to true. Unfortunately, <tt>is_copy_constructible</tt> cannot reliably determine whether 
<tt>T</tt> is really copy-constructible. A class may contain public non-deleted copy constructor whose 
definition does not exist or cannot be instantiated successfully (e.g., 
<tt>std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt;&gt;</tt> has copy constructor, but this type is not 
copy-constructible). Thus, the actual requirements should be:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
if <tt>!is_nothrow_move_constructible&lt;T&gt;::value &amp;&amp; is_copy_constructible&lt;T&gt;::value</tt> 
then <tt>T</tt> shall be <tt>CopyInsertable</tt> into <tt>*this</tt>;
</p></li>
<li><p>
otherwise <tt>T</tt> shall be <tt>MoveInsertable</tt> into <tt>*this</tt>.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Maybe it would be useful to introduce a new name for such conditional requirement (in addition to 
"<tt>CopyInsertable</tt>" and "<tt>MoveInsertable</tt>").
</p>

<p><i>[2016-08 Chicago]</i></p>

<p>
The problem does not appear to be as severe as described. The <tt>MoveInsertable</tt>
requirements are consistently correct, but an issue may arise on the
exception-safety guarantees when we check for
<tt>is_copy_constructible_v&lt;T&gt;</tt>.  The problem, as described, is
typically for templates that appear to have a copy constructor, but one that
fails to compile once instantiated, and so gives a misleading result for the
trait.
</p>
<p>
In general, users should not provide such types, and the standard would not
serve users well by trying to address support for such types.  However, the
standard should not be providing such types either, such as
<tt>vector&lt;unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt>.  A possible resolution would be
to tighten the constraints in Table 80 &mdash; Container Requirements, so that if
the Requirements for the copy constructor/assingment operator of a container
are not satisfied, that operation shall be deleted.
</p>
<p>
A futher problem highlighted by this approach is that there are no constraints on
the copy-assignment operator, so that <tt>vector&lt;unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt>
should be <tt>CopyAssignable</tt>! However, we can lift the equivalent constraints from
the Allocator-aware container requirements.

<p>
According to 25.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/algorithms.general">[algorithms.general]</a>/12,
</p>
<blockquote><p>
In the description of the algorithms operators <tt>+</tt> and <tt>-</tt> are used for some of the iterator categories 
for which they do not have to be defined. In these cases the semantics of <tt>a+n</tt> is the same as that of
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
X tmp = a;
advance(tmp, n);
return tmp;
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are several places where such operator <tt>+</tt> is applied to an output iterator &mdash; for example, see the 
description of <tt>std::copy</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class InputIterator, class OutputIterator&gt;
OutputIterator copy(InputIterator first, InputIterator last,
                    OutputIterator result);
</pre>
<blockquote><p>
-1- <i>Effects</i>: Copies elements in the range <tt>[first,last)</tt> into the range <tt>[result,result + (last -
first))</tt> starting from <tt>first</tt> and proceeding to <tt>last</tt>. For each non-negative integer 
<tt>n &lt; (last - first)</tt>, performs <tt>*(result + n) = *(first + n)</tt>.
</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
<tt>std::advance</tt> is not supposed to be applicable to output iterators, so we need a different method of description.

</p>

<p><i>[2014-06-07 Daniel comments and provides wording]</i></p>

<p>
The specification for output iterators is somewhat tricky, because here a sequence of increments is required to
be combined with intervening <em>assignments</em> to the dereferenced iterator. I tried to respect this
fact by using a conceptual assignment operation as part of the specification.
<p/>
Another problem in the provided as-if-code is the question which requirements are imposed on <tt>n</tt>. Unfortunately,
the corresponding function <tt>advance</tt> is completely underspecified in this regard, so I couldn't borrow wording
from it. We cannot even assume here that <tt>n</tt> is the difference type of the iterator, because for output iterators there is
no requirements for this associated type to be defined. The presented wording attempts to minimize assumptions, but still
can be considered as controversial.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
The hash functor and key-comparison functor of unordered containers are allowed to throw on <tt>swap</tt>.
</p>
<p>
22.2.7.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unord.req.except">[unord.req.except]</a>p3 "For unordered associative containers, no <tt>swap</tt> function throws
an exception unless that exception is thrown by the swap of the container's Hash or Pred object (if any)."
</p>
<p>
In such a case we must offer the basic exception safety guarantee, where both objects are left in valid
but unspecified states, and no resources are leaked.  This yields a corrupt, un-usable container if the
first <tt>swap</tt> succeeds, but the second fails by throwing, as the functors form a matched pair.
</p>
<p>
So our basic scenario is first, swap the allocators if the allocators propagate on swap, according to
<tt>allocator_traits</tt>.  Next we swap the pointers to our internal hash table data structures, so that
they match the allocators that allocated them.  (Typically, this operation cannot throw).  Now our containers
are back in a safely destructible state if an exception follows.
</p>
<p>
Next, let's say we swap the hash functor, and that throws.  We have a corrupt data structure, in that the
buckets are not correctly indexed by the correct functors, lookups will give unpredicatable results etc.
We can safely restore a usable state by forcibly clearing each container - which does not leak resources
and leaves us with two (empty but) usable containers.
</p>
<p>
Now let us assume that the hasher swap succeeds.  Next we swap the equality comparator functor, and this
too could throw. The important point to bear in mind is that these two functors form an important pairing
- two objects that compare equal by the equality functor must also hash to the same value.  If we swap
one without the other, we most likely leave the container in an unusable state, even if we clear out all
elements.
</p>
<p>
1. A colleague pointed out that the solution for this is to dynamically allocate the two functors, and then
we need only swap pointers, which is not a throwing operation.  And if we don't want to allocate on default
construction (a common QoI request), we might consider moving to a dynamically allocated functors whenever
<tt>swap</tt> is called, or on first insertion.  Of course, allocating memory in <tt>swap</tt> is a whole
new can of worms, but this does not really sound like the design we had intended.
</p>

<p>
2. The simplest option is to say that we do not support hasher or equality functors that throw on ADL
<tt>swap</tt>.  Note that the requirement is simply to not throw, rather than to be explicitly
marked as <tt>noexcept</tt>.  Throwing functors are allowed, so long as we never use values that
would actually manifest a throw when used in an unordered container.
</p>

<p>
Pablo went on to give me several more options, to be sure we have a full set to consider:
</p>
<p>
3. Disallow one or the other functor from throwing.  In that case, the 
possibly-throwing functor must be swapped first, then the other functor, 
the allocator, and the data pointer(s) afterwards (in any order -- there 
was a TC that allocator assignment and swap may not throw if the 
corresponding propagation trait is true.). Of course, the question 
becomes: which functor is allowed to throw and which one is not?
</p>
<p>
4. Require that any successful functor <tt>swap</tt> be reliably reversible.  
This is very inventive.  I know of no other place in the standard where 
such a requirement is stated, though I have occasionally wanted such a 
guarantee.
</p>
<p>
5. Allow a failed swap to leave the containers in a state where future 
insertions may fail for reasons other than is currently allowed.  
Specifically, if the hash and equality functors are out of sync, all 
insertions will fail.  Presumably some "incompletely swapped" exception 
would be thrown.  This is "slightly" inventive, although people have been 
discussing "radioactive" states for a while.

<p>
30.10.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.results.const">[re.results.const]</a>/3: "Move-constructs an object of class <tt>match_results</tt> satisfying the same 
postconditions as Table 141."
</p>
<p>
Table 141 lists various member functions and says that their results should be the results of the corresponding member 
function calls on <tt>m</tt>. But <tt>m</tt> has been moved from, so the actual requirement ought to be based on the 
value that <tt>m</tt> had <em>before</em> the move construction, not on <tt>m</tt> itself.
</p>
<p>
In addition to that, the requirements for the copy constructor should refer to Table 141.
<p/>
<u>Ganesh</u>:
<p/>
Also, the requirements for move-assignment should refer to Table 141. Further it seems as if in Table 141 all phrases of
"for all integers <tt>n &lt; m.size()</tt>" should be replaced by "for all <em>unsigned</em> integers 
<tt>n &lt; m.size()</tt>".
</p>

<p><i>[2019-03-26; Daniel comments and provides wording]</i></p>

<p>
The previous Table 141 (Now Table 128 in <a href="http://wg21.link/n4810">N4810</a>) has been modified to cover now
the effects of move/copy constructors and move/copy assignment operators. Newly added wording now clarifies that for
move operations the corresponding values refer to the values of the move source <em>before</em> the operation has started.
<p/>
Re Ganesh's proposal: Note that no further wording is needed for the move-assignment operator, because in the current 
working draft the move-assignment operator's <i>Effects:</i> element refers already to Table 128. The suggested clarification
of <em>unsigned</em> integers has been implemented by referring to <em>non-negative</em> integers instead.
<p/>
Upon suggestion from Casey, the wording also introduces <i>Ensures:</i> elements that refer to Table 128 and as drive-by fix
eliminates a "<i>Throws:</i> Nothing." element from a <tt>noexcept</tt> function.

It should be clarified, whether (a) constructors are an exception of above mentioned operations or (b) whether
at least some of them (like those accepting a <tt>match_results</tt> value and an allocator) should be added.
<p/>
As visible in several places of the standard (including the core language), constructors seem usually to be considered 
as "operations" and they certainly can be invoked for const-qualified objects.
<p/>
The below given proposed resolution applies only the minimum necessary fix, i.e. it excludes constructors from
above requirement.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
The user cannot specify a <tt>max_load_factor</tt> for their unordered container
at construction, it must be supplied after the event, when the container is
potentially not empty.  The contract for this method is deliberately vague, not
guaranteeing to use the value supplied by the user, and any value actually used
will be used as a ceiling that the container will <i>attempt</i> to respect.
</p>
<p>
The only guarantee we have is that, if user requests a <tt>max_load_factor</tt>
that is less than the current <tt>load_factor</tt>, then the operation will take
constant time, thus outlawing an implementation that chooses to rehash and so
preserve as a class invariant that <tt>load_factor &lt; max_load_factor</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Reasonable options conforming to the standard include ignoring the user's request
if the requested value is too low, or deferring the rehash to the next <tt>insert</tt>
operation and allowing the container to have a strange state (wrt <tt>max_load_factor</tt>)
until then - and there is still the question of rehashing if the next <tt>insert</tt>
is for a duplicate key in a unique container.
</p>
<p>
Given the deliberate vagueness of the current wording, to support a range of reasonable
(but not <i>perfect</i>) behaviors, it is not clear why the equally reasonable rehash
to restore the constraint should be outlawed.  It is not thought that this is a performance
critical operation, where users will be repeatedly setting low load factors on populated
containers, in a tight or (less unlikely) an instant response scenario.

<p>Sat PM: Howard to provide wording</p>

<p><i>[2016-11-17 Howard provided wording.]</i></p>


<blockquote>
<p>
The provided wording is consistent with LWG discussion in Issaquah.  An implementation
of the proposed wording would be setting <tt>max_load_factor()</tt> to
<tt>max(z, load_factor())</tt>.  This preserves the container invariant:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
load_factor() &lt;= max_load_factor()
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
And it preserves the existing behavior that no rehash is done by this operation.
</p>
<p>
If it is desired to change the <tt>max_load_factor()</tt> to something smaller than
the current <tt>load_factor()</tt> that can be done by <i>first reducing</i> the
current <tt>load_factor()</tt> by either increasing <tt>bucket_count()</tt> (via
<tt>rehash</tt> or <tt>reserve</tt>), or decreasing <tt>size()</tt> (e.g.
<tt>erase</tt>), <i>and then</i> changing <tt>max_load_factor()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
This resolution reaffirms that <tt>load_factor() &lt;= max_load_factor()</tt> is a
container invariant which can <i>never</i> be violated.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>[2016-11-27, Nico comments]</i></p>

<p>
Current implementations behave differently.

In regard to the sentence

</blockquote>
Note that the current spec says that there is constant complexity
<em>without</em> any precondition. So, rehashing to keep the invariant would
violate the spec (which is probably not be the intention).

<p>
In 22.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/sequence.reqmts">[sequence.reqmts]</a> p3, we have "<tt>il</tt> designates an object of type
<tt>initializer_list&lt;value_type&gt;</tt>", and then several functions that take
'<tt>il</tt>' as an argument. However, an expression like <tt>{1, 2, 'a'}</tt> is <em>not</em>
an object of type <tt>initializer_list&lt;int&gt;</tt> unless it's used to initialize
an explicitly-typed variable of that type. I believe we want:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::vector&lt;int&gt; v;
v = {1, 2, 'a'};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
to compile portably, so we should say something different when defining '<tt>il</tt>'. The 
same phrasing happens in 22.2.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/associative.reqmts">[associative.reqmts]</a>, 22.2.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unord.req">[unord.req]</a>, and

This may just be an editorial issue because the actual class synopses declare the functions

</p>

<p><i>[2019-03-26; Daniel comments and provides wording]</i></p>

<p>
The 2013-03-15 comment is confusing, since it recommends to "copy the suggested wording as the proposed resolution". 
I couldn't find such wording in the issue nor in the associated wiki, so I provided that wording out of myself.
The tricky part is to define which kind of <i>braced-init-list</i> we want to allow. As Tim Song pointed out, we
still need the existing support for <tt>std::initializer_list&lt;value_type&gt;</tt> as well, because otherwise
existing semantics based on expressions such as <tt>li.begin()</tt> won't work anymore.
The below suggested wording restricts supported <i>braced-init-list</i>s to every initializer list that can be used 
to copy-list-initialize an object of type <tt>std::initializer_list&lt;value_type&gt;</tt> by saying:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"<tt>bil</tt> designates any <i>braced-init-list</i> suitable to copy-list-initialize an object of type 
<tt>initializer_list&lt;value_type&gt;</tt> (9.3.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/dcl.init.list">[dcl.init.list]</a>)"
</p></blockquote>
<p>
As a drive-by fix, the provided wording adds another initialization "expression" that makes the construction 
of the form
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::vector&lt;int&gt; v = {1, 2, 'a'};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
valid (We just miss a copy-initialization case).

<h3><a name="2214" href="2214">2214.</a> Clarify <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> call restrictions</h3>

<p><b>View all issues with</b> <a href="lwg-status.html#Open">Open</a> status.</p>
<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
There is an ambiguity in how <tt>std::basic_ios::init</tt> method (29.5.5.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/basic.ios.cons">[basic.ios.cons]</a>) 
can be used in the derived class. The Standard only specify the state of the <tt>basic_ios</tt> 
object after the call completes. However, in <tt>basic_ios</tt> default constructor description 
(29.5.5.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/basic.ios.cons">[basic.ios.cons]</a>) there is this sentence:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Effects</i>: Constructs an object of class <tt>basic_ios</tt> (29.5.3.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/ios.base.cons">[ios.base.cons]</a>) 
leaving its member objects uninitialized. The object shall be initialized by calling <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> 
before its first use or before it is destroyed, whichever comes first; otherwise the behavior is undefined.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This restriction hints that <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> should be called exactly
once before the object can be used or destroyed, because <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> 
may not know whether it was called before or not (i.e. whether its members are actually 
uninitialized or are initialized by the previous call to <tt>basic_ios::init</tt>). There 
is no such restriction in the <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> preconditions so it is not clear whether it is
allowed to call <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> multiple times or not.
<p/>
This problem has already affected publicly available implementations.
For example, Microsoft Visual C++ STL introduces a memory leak if
<tt>basic_ios::init</tt> is called multiple times, while GCC 4.7 and STLPort
reinitialize the <tt>basic_ios</tt> object correctly without memory leak or any
other undesired effects. There was a discussion of this issue on Boost
<a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.boost.devel/235659">developers mailing list</a>, 
and there is a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/boost-log/ticket/2#comment:4">test case 
that reproduces the problem</a>. The test case is actually a bug report for my Boost.Log library, 
which attempts to cache <tt>basic_ostream</tt>-derived objects internally to avoid expensive construction 
and destruction. My stream objects allowed resetting the stream buffer pointers the stream
is attached to, without requiring to destroy and construct the stream.
<p/>
My personal view of the problem and proposed resolution follows.
<p/>
While apparently the intent of <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> is to provide a way to
initialize <tt>basic_ios</tt> after default construction, I see no reason to
forbid it from being called multiple times to reinitialize the stream.
Furthermore, it is possible to implement a conforming <tt>basic_ios</tt> that
does not have this restriction.
<p/>
The quoted above section of the Standard that describes the effects of
the default constructor is misleading. The Standard does not mandate
any data members of <tt>basic_ios</tt> or <tt>ios_base</tt> (29.5.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/ios.base">[ios.base]</a>), which
it derives from. This means that the implementation is allowed to use
non-POD data members with default constructors that initialize the
members with particular default values. For example, in the case of
Microsoft Visual C++ STL the leaked memory is an <tt>std::locale</tt> instance
that is dynamically allocated during <tt>basic_ios::init</tt>, a raw pointer to
which is stored within ios_base. It is possible to store e.g. an
<tt>unique_ptr</tt> instead of a raw pointer as a member of <tt>ios_base</tt>, the smart
pointer will default initialize the underlying raw pointer on default
construction and automatically destroy the allocated object upon being
reset or destroyed, which would eliminate the leak and allow
<tt>basic_ios::init</tt> to be called multiple times. This leads to conclusion
that the default constructor of <tt>basic_ios</tt> cannot leave "its member
objects uninitialized" but instead performs default initialization of
the member objects, which would mean the same thing in case of POD types.
<p/>
However, I feel that restricting <tt>ios_base</tt> and <tt>basic_ios</tt> members to
non-POD types is not acceptable. Since multiple calls to <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> are 
not forbidden by the Standard, I propose to correct the <tt>basic_ios</tt> default 
constructor description so that it is allowed to destroy <tt>basic_ios</tt> object 
without calling <tt>basic_ios::init</tt>. This would imply that any raw members of 
<tt>basic_ios</tt> and <tt>ios_base</tt> should be initialized to values suitable for 
destruction (essentially, this means only initializing raw pointers to NULL). The new 
wording could look like this:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Effects</i>: Constructs an object of class <tt>basic_ios</tt> (29.5.3.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/ios.base.cons">[ios.base.cons]</a>)
initializing its member objects to unspecified state, only suitable for <tt>basic_ios</tt> destruction.
The object shall be initialized by calling <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> before its first use; otherwise 
the behavior is undefined.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This would remove the hint that <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> must be called exactly
once. Also, this would remove the requirement for <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> to
be called at all before the destruction. This is also an important issue because 
the derived stream constructor may throw an exception before it manages to call 
<tt>basic_ios::init</tt> (for example, if the streambuf constructor throws), and 
in this case the <tt>basic_ios</tt> destructor has undefined behavior.
<p/>
To my mind, the described modification is sufficient to resolve the issue. But to 
emphasize the possibility to call <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> multiple times, a remark 
or a footnote for <tt>basic_ios::init</tt> postconditions could be added to explicitly 
state the semantics of calling it multiple times. The note could read as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The function can be called multiple times during the object lifetime. Each subsequent 
call reinitializes the object to the described in postconditions initial state.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>[2013-04-20, Bristol]</i></p>


<p>
Alisdair: The current wording is unclear but the proposed resolution is wrong
<p/>
Solution: Clarify that <tt>init</tt> must be called once and only once. Move then to review.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The requirements on the functors used to arrange elements in the various associative and
unordered containers are given by a set of expressions in tables 102 &mdash; Associative container
requirements, and 103 &mdash; Unordered associative container requirements.  In keeping with Library
convention these expressions make the minimal requirements necessary on their types.  For
example, we have the following 3 row extracts for the unordered containers:
</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td>
    <b>Expression</b>
  </td>
  <td>
    <b>Assertion/note pre-/post-condition</b>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
<pre>
<tt>X(n, hf, eq)</tt>
<tt>X a(n, hf, eq)</tt>
</pre>
  </td>
  <td>
    <i>Requires:</i> <tt>hasher</tt> and <tt>key_equal</tt> are <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>.
 </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
<pre>
<tt>X(n, hf)</tt>
<tt>X a(n, hf)</tt>
</pre>
  </td>
  <td>
    <i>Requires:</i> <tt>hasher</tt> is <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> and 
                  <tt>key_equal</tt> is <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>.
 </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
<pre>
<tt>X(n)</tt>
<tt>X a(n)</tt>
</pre>
  </td>
  <td>
    <i>Requires:</i> <tt>hasher</tt> and <tt>key_equal</tt> are <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>.
 </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
However, the signature for each class template requires that the functors must effectively be
<tt>CopyConstructible</tt> for each of these expressions:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class Key,
          class T,
          class Hash  = hash&lt;Key>,
          class Pred  = std::equal_to&lt;Key>,
          class Allocator = std::allocator&lt;std::pair&lt;const Key, T> > >
class unordered_map
{
  <i>...</i>

  <i>// construct/destroy/copy</i>
  explicit unordered_map(size_type n = <i>see below</i>,
                         const hasher&amp; hf = hasher(),
                         const key_equal&amp; eql = key_equal(),
                         const allocator_type&amp; a = allocator_type());

  <i>...</i>
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The letter of the standard can be honored as long as implementors recognize
their freedom to split this one signature into multiple overloads, so that
the documented default arguments (requiring a <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> functor)
are not actually passed as default arguments.
</p>
<p>
As we look into the requirements for the copy constructor and copy-assignment
operator, the requirements are even more vague, as the explicit requirements on
the functors are not called out, other than saying that the functors are copied.
</p>
<p>
Must the functors be <tt>CopyAssignable</tt>? Or is <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>
sufficient in this case?  Do we require that the functors be <tt>Swappable</tt>
so that the copy-swap idiom can be deployed here?  Note that a type that is both
<tt>CopyConstructible</tt> and <tt>CopyAssignable</tt> is still not guaranteed to
be <tt>Swappable</tt> as the user may delete the <tt>swap</tt> function for their
type in their own namespace, which would be found via ADL.
</p>
<p>
Some clean-up of the requirements table looks necessary, to at least document the
assignment behavior.  In addition, we should have clear guidance on whether these
functors should always be <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>, as suggested by the class
template definitions, or if the requirement tables are correct and we should
explicitly split up the constructors in the (unordered) associative containers
to no longer use default (function) arguments to obtain their defaulted functors.
</p>
<p>
I recommend the simplest solution would be to always require that the functors
for (unordered) associative containers be <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>, above the
requirements tables themselves, so that the issue need not be addressed within
the tables.  I suggest that the assignment operators for these containers add
the requirement that the functors be <tt>Swappable</tt>, rather than forwarding
the corresponding <tt>Assignable</tt> requirement.

The revised resolution of LWG <a href="2227">2227</a> should resolve this issue as well. It follows the recommendations

<p>
This appears to require the result to have a default-constructed
allocator, which isn't even possible for all allocator types. I
suspect the allocator should be copied from 's' instead. Possibly
there should be an additional defaulted argument to override the
allocator of the result.

Consider the following example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::string str0("x");
std::regex rg0("a");
std::regex_token_iterator it0(str0.begin(), str0.end(), rg0, -1); // points at "x" in str0
std::string str1("x");
std::regex rg1("b");
std::regex_token_iterator it1(str1.begin(), str1.end(), rg1, -1); // points at "x" in str1
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
30.12.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.tokiter.comp">[re.tokiter.comp]</a> p1 says that <tt>it0.operator==(it1)</tt> returns true "if
<tt>*this</tt> and <tt>right</tt> are both suffix iterators and <tt>suffix == right.suffix</tt>"; both
conditions are satisfied in this example. It does not say that they must both be iterators
into the same sequence, nor does it say (as general iterator requirements do) that they must
both be in the domain of <tt>==</tt> in order for the comparison to be meaningful. It's a
simple statement: they're equal if the strings they point at compare equal. Given this being
a valid comparison, the obtained result of "true" looks odd.
<p/>
The problem is that for iterator values prior to the suffix iterator, equality means the same
regular expression and the same matched sequence (both uses of "same" refer to identity, not equality);
for the suffix iterator, equality means that the matched sequences compare equal.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
Table 102 in 22.2.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/associative.reqmts">[associative.reqmts]</a>/8 states on expression <tt>a.key_comp()</tt> that it 
"returns the comparison object out of which a was constructed". At the same time, 
22.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a>/8 states (starting in the third line) that 
"...Any <tt>Compare</tt>, <tt>Pred</tt>, or <tt>Hash</tt> objects belonging to <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> 
shall be swappable and <em>shall be exchanged</em> by unqualified calls to non-member swap...". This is 
problematic for any compliant implementation, since once swapped the container cannot return the comparison 
object out of which it was constructed unless incurring in storing an otherwise needless object.
<p/>
The simple solution is to correct that statement in Table 102, but I believe this is part of a larger problem 
of underspecified behavior: The new standard has made an effort in regards to allocators and now fully 
specifies what happens to stateful allocator objects. It has even specified what happens to stateful <tt>hasher</tt> 
and <tt>key_equal</tt> members of unordered containers (they propagate), but it says nothing about stateful 
comparison objects of (ordered) associative containers, except for the statement in 
22.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a>/8 referred above and only related to <tt>swap</tt>.
<p/>
For example, it is unclear to me what is specified to happen on an assignment: should the comparison object 
be copied/moved along with the elements, or should the left-hand side object keep its own?
Maybe this has been intentionally left unspecified with the purpose of compatibility with C++98, which I 
understand it specified that comparison objects were kept for the entire life of the container (like allocators) 
&mdash; an unfortunate choice. But anyway, the segment of 22.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a> quoted 
above seems to break any possible backwards compatibility with C++98 in this regard.
<p/>
Therefore, taking into consideration consistency with how this is dealed with for unordered associative 
containers, I propose that Table 102 is modified as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The row for expression <tt>a.key_comp()</tt> is changed so that its "assertion/note pre-/post-condition" reads 
"Returns <tt>a</tt>'s comparison object."
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
A new row is added at the appropriate location (which I believe would be after "X(il)" row), with:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1">

<p><i>[2015-10-19 Daniel comments and provides alternative wording]</i></p>

<p>
The current standard is especially unclear in regard to what effects move operations of unordered/associative
containers should have. We have one example that is standardized exactly in this way by looking at 
22.6.5.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/priqueue.cons.alloc">[priqueue.cons.alloc]</a> p7:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template &lt;class Alloc&gt; priority_queue(priority_queue&amp;&amp; q, const Alloc&amp; a);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-7- <i>Effects</i>: Initializes <tt>c</tt> with <tt>std::move(q.c)</tt> as the first argument and <tt>a</tt> as 
the second argument, and initializes <tt>comp</tt> with <tt>std::move(q.comp)</tt>
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
A similarly comparable example are the move-operations of <tt>std::unique_ptr</tt> in regard to the deleter 
(when this is no a reference), which also respect move-capabilities of that function object.
<p/>
We have wording from C++98 for associative containers (but <em>not</em> for unordered containers!) that was never
adjusted to C++11 move-semantics in 22.2.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/associative.reqmts">[associative.reqmts]</a> p12:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
When an associative container is constructed by passing a comparison object the container shall not store
a pointer or reference to the passed object, even if that object is passed by reference. When an associative
container is copied, either through a copy constructor or an assignment operator, the target container shall
then use the comparison object from the container being copied, as if that comparison object had been
passed to the target container in its constructor.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The second sentence of this wording is problematic for several reasons:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It only talks about copy operations, not about move operations, except that the term "assignment" without
leading "copy" is a bit ambigious (albeit it seems clear in the complete context).</p></li>
<li><p>It is not really clear how to interpret "as if that comparison object had been
passed to the target container in its constructor" for an assignment operation. A possible but not conclusive
interpretation could be that this is wording supporting a "copy-via-swap" idiom.</p></li>
<li><p>There does not exist similar wording for unordered containers, except that Table 102 provides entries for
copy construction and copy assignment of the containers whose wording just talks of "copies" in either case.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Existing implementations differ already:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Visual Studio 2015 uses copy construction and copy assignment for the two copy operations but uses swap operations
for the move operations.</p></li>
<li><p>GCC's libstdc++ performs copy construction and copy assignment for the two copy operations and for the two
move operations, respectively</p></li>
<li><p>clang++'s libc++ performs copy/move construction and copy/move assignment for the corresponding
four copy/move operations</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
The alternative wording provided below attempts to clarify that container copy/move operations perform the corresponding
copy/move operations on the owned function objects.
<p/>
In addition the wording also resolves LWG <a href="2215">2215</a>: I believe that the current
wording should require that container function objects should meet the <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> requirements. Adding
this general requirement also fixes the underspecified requirements of the accessor functions <tt>key_comp()</tt> and
<tt>value_comp()</tt>.
<p/>
I don't think that a general requirement for <tt>Swappable</tt> is needed, only the member <tt>swap</tt> function currently requires this.
Nonetheless the wording below does <em>support</em> stateful functors that are <em>also</em> moveable or move-assignable,
therefore the specified semantics in terms of move operations.
<p/>
I should add the following warning, though: If this proposed wording would be accepted, there is a little chance of
code breakage, because the current wording <em>can</em> be read that in general there is no requirement that the
container functors are <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>. The following code example is accepted by gcc + libstd++:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;map&gt;
#include &lt;utility&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct Cmp {
  Cmp() = default;
  Cmp(const Cmp&amp;) = delete;
  Cmp(Cmp&amp;&amp;) = delete;
  Cmp&amp; operator=(const Cmp&amp;) = delete;
  Cmp&amp; operator=(Cmp&amp;&amp;) = delete;
  template&lt;class T&gt;
  bool operator()(const T&amp; x, const T&amp; y) const
  {
    return x &lt; y;
  }
};

typedef std::map&lt;int, int, Cmp&gt; MyMap;

int main() {
  MyMap m;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; (m.find(12) == m.end()) &lt;&lt; std::endl;

<p>
In addition to the <i>Cpp17CopyConstructible</i> discussion going on there, I think we need to require that

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The "magic" <tt>kill_dependency</tt> function is a function without any constraints on the template parameter <tt>T</tt> 
and is specified as
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;
T kill_dependency(T y) noexcept;
</pre><blockquote>
<p>
-14- <i>Effects</i>: The argument does not carry a dependency to the return value (1.10).
<p/>
-15- <i>Returns</i>: <tt>y</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
I wonder whether the unconditional <tt>noexcept</tt> is really intended here:
Assume we have some type <tt>U</tt> that has a potentially throwing move
constructor (or it has a potentially throwing copy constructor and no
move constructor), for any "normal" function template with the same
signature and the same effects (modulo the dependency magic) this
would mean that it cannot safely be declared <tt>noexcept</tt> because of the
return statement being part of the complete function call affected by
<tt>noexcept</tt> (The by-value function argument is irrelevant in this
context). In other words it seems that a function call such as
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
struct S {
  ...
  S(const S&amp; r) { if(<em>some condition</em>) throw Something(); }
  ...
};

int main() {
  S s1 = ...;
  S s2 = std::kill_dependency(s1);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
would be required to call <tt>std::terminate</tt> if the copy constructor of <tt>S</tt> throws during the return 
of <tt>std::kill_dependency</tt>.
<p/>
To require copy elision for this already magic function would look like a low-hanging fruit to solve this problem, 
but this case is not covered by current copy elision rules see 12.8 p31 b1:
<p/>
"&mdash; in a return statement in a function with a class return type, when the expression is the name of a non-volatile 
automatic object (other than a function or catch-clause parameter) with the same <em>cv</em>-unqualified type as the 
function return type, the copy/move operation can be omitted by constructing the automatic object directly into the
function's return value".
<p/>
Some options come into my mind:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Make the exception-specification a constrained one in regard via <tt>std::is_nothrow_move_constructible</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;
T kill_dependency(T y) noexcept(<em>see below</em>);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This is similar to the approach taken for function templates such as <tt>std::swap</tt>.
</p>
</li>

<li><p>
Use perfect forwarding (This needs further wording to correct the effects):
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;
T&amp;&amp; kill_dependency(T&amp;&amp; y) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>
Impose constraints on the template arguments in regard to throwing exceptions while copying/moving.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Keep the state as it is but possibly add a note about a call of <tt>std::terminate</tt> in above scenario.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
A second problem is that the current wording is not clear whether it is well-defined to call the function with
types that are reference types, such as in the following example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;atomic&gt;

int main()
{
  int a = 12;
  int&amp; b = std::kill_dependency&lt;int&amp;&gt;(a);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
It is unclear what kind of dependency is killed here. This is presumably a core language problem, but could
affect the possible resolutions of the problem.
</p>

<p><i>[2014-11 Urbana]</i></p>

<p>
Recommend using a revised example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
int lookup(class D* p) 
{
  class E* q = p-&gt;a.load(memory_order_consume);
  int y = std::kill_dependency(q-&gt;y);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Handed over to SG1.

<p>
The non-explicit nature of the iterator-pair constructor of containers, such a
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class InputIterator&gt;
vector(InputIterator first, InputIterator last, const Allocator&amp; = Allocator());
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
can be selected in unexpected situations, leading to a hard runtime error, as demonstrated by the following example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;vector&gt;

void f(std::vector&lt;char&gt; v){ /* ... */}

int main() {
  f({"A", "B"});
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The actually intended initializer-list constructor isn't feasible here, so the best match is the constructor template
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class InputIterator&gt;
vector(InputIterator first, InputIterator last, const Allocator&amp; = Allocator());
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This compiles, but will result in code running amok. The potential trap (that cannot be easily detected by the
library implementation) could be reduced by making this constructor explicit. It would still have the effect to 
be selected here, but the code would be ill-formed, so the programmer gets a clear message here.

and that it's been superseded by IEEE-754.

<p>
N3337 20.11.1.2.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unique.ptr.single.modifiers">[unique.ptr.single.modifiers]</a> contains 2 non-normative notes stating:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[para 4]: &quot;The order of these operations is significant because the call to <tt>get_deleter()</tt> 
may destroy <tt>*this</tt>.&quot;
</p>
<p>
[para 5]: &quot;The postcondition does not hold if the call to <tt>get_deleter()</tt> destroys <tt>*this</tt> since 
<tt>this->get()</tt> is no longer a valid expression.&quot;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It seems this wording was created to resolve <a href="998">998</a> due to the possibility that a <tt>unique_ptr</tt> may be 
destroyed through deletion of its stored pointer where that directly or indirectly refers to the same <tt>unique_ptr</tt>. 
If <tt>unique_ptr</tt> is required to support circular references then it seems this must be normative text: an implementation 
is currently allowed to operate on <tt>*this</tt> after the assignment and deletion specified in para 4, since this is only 
'disallowed' by the non-normative note.
</p>

<p>I propose the following draft rewording:</p>

<p>
[para 4]: <i>Effects</i>: assigns <tt>p</tt> to the stored pointer, and then if the old value of the stored pointer, <tt>old_p</tt>, was not
equal to <tt>nullptr</tt>, calls <tt>get_deleter()(old_p)</tt>. <ins>No operation shall be performed after the call to 
<tt>get_deleter()(old_p)</tt> that requires <tt>*this</tt> to be valid, because the deletion may destroy <tt>*this</tt> if it is 
referred to directly or indirectly by the stored pointer.</ins> <del>[<i>Note:</i> The order of these operations is significant
because the call to <tt>get_deleter()</tt> may destroy <tt>*this</tt>. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]</del>
<p/>
[para 5]: <i>Postconditions</i>: <ins>If the call <tt>get_deleter()(old_p)</tt> destroyed <tt>*this</tt>, none. Otherwise,</ins> 
<tt>get() == p</tt>. <del>[<i>Note:</i> The postcondition does not hold if the call to <tt>get_deleter()</tt>
destroys <tt>*this</tt> since <tt>this->get()</tt> is no longer a valid expression. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]</del>
</p>

<p>
I expect it will also be necessary to amend the requirements for a deleter, so in addition:
</p>

<p>
20.11.1.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unique.ptr.single">[unique.ptr.single]</a> [para 1]: The default type for the template parameter <tt>D</tt> is <tt>default_delete</tt>. 
A client-supplied template argument <tt>D</tt> shall be a function object type (20.10), lvalue-reference to function, or 
lvalue-reference to function object type for which, given a value <tt>d</tt> of type <tt>D</tt> and a value <tt>ptr</tt> of type 
<tt>unique_ptr&lt;T, D&gt;::pointer</tt>, the expression <tt>d(ptr)</tt> is valid and has the effect of disposing of the pointer 
as appropriate for that deleter. <ins>Where <tt>D</tt> is not an lvalue reference type, <tt>d(ptr)</tt> shall be valid if <tt>ptr</tt> 
refers directly or indirectly to the invoking <tt>unique_ptr</tt> object.</ins>
</p>

<p><i>[2013-10-05, Stephan T. Lavavej comments and provides alternative wording]</i></p>

<p>
In Chicago, we determined that the original proposed change to 20.11.1.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unique.ptr.single">[unique.ptr.single]</a>/1 was insufficient, because 
<tt>d</tt> might be a reference to a deleter functor that's destroyed during self-destruction.
<p/>
We believed that 20.11.1.2.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unique.ptr.single.modifiers">[unique.ptr.single.modifiers]</a>/4 was already sufficiently clear. The Standard occasionally prevents 
implementations of <tt>X</tt> from doing various things, through the principle of "nothing allows <tt>X</tt> to fail in that situation".  
For example, <tt>v.push_back(v[0])</tt> is required to work for non-empty vectors because nothing allows that to fail. In this case, 
the intent to allow self-destruction is already clear.
<p/>
Additionally, we did not believe that 20.11.1.2.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unique.ptr.single.modifiers">[unique.ptr.single.modifiers]</a>/5 had to be changed. The current note is slightly 
squirrely but it does not lead to confusion for implementers or users.

<p>
I believe that the following variation on IRIW should admit executions in
which <tt>c1 = d1 = 5</tt> and <tt>c2 = d2 = 0</tt>.  If this is allowed, then what is sequence of
program evaluations for 31.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p9 that justifies the store to <tt>z</tt>?  It seems that
31.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p9 should not allow this execution because one of the stores to <tt>x</tt> or <tt>y</tt> has
to appear earlier in the sequence, each of the <tt>fetch_adds</tt> reads the previous load in the thread (and thus must 
appear later in the sequence), and 31.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p9 states that each load must read from the last prior 
assignment in the sequence.
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
atomic_int x;
atomic_int y;
atomic_int z;
int c1, c2, d1, d2;

static void a(void* obj)
{
  atomic_store_explicit(&amp;x, 5, memory_order_relaxed); 
}

static void b(void* obj)
{
  atomic_store_explicit(&amp;y, 5, memory_order_relaxed); 
}

static void c(void* obj)
{
  c1 = atomic_load_explicit(&amp;x, memory_order_relaxed);
  // this could also be an atomic load if the address depends on c1:
  c2 = atomic_fetch_add_explicit(&amp;y, c1, memory_order_relaxed);  
}

static void d(void* obj)
{
  d1 = atomic_load_explicit(&amp;y, memory_order_relaxed);
  d2 = atomic_fetch_add_explicit(&amp;x, d1, memory_order_relaxed); 
}

int user_main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  thrd_t t1, t2, t3, t4;

  atomic_init(&amp;x, 0);
  atomic_init(&amp;y, 0);

  printf("Main thread: creating 4 threads\n");
  thrd_create(&amp;t1, (thrd_start_t)&amp;a, NULL);

<p>
It seems that the easiest fix is to allow a load in 31.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.order">[atomics.order]</a> p9 to read from any prior
store in the evaluation order.
<p/>
That said, I would personally advocate the following:
It seems to me that C/C++ atomics are in a bit of different situation than Java
because:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>People are expected to use relaxed C++ atomics in potentially racy
situations, so it isn't clear that semantics as complicated as the JMM's
causality would be sane.
</p></li>
<li><p>People who use C/C++ atomics are likely to be experts and use them in a
very controlled fashion. I would be really surprised if compilers would find
any real wins by optimizing the use of atomics.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Why not do something like:
<p/>
There is satisfaction DAG of all program evaluations. Each evaluation
observes the values of variables as computed by some prior assignment in
the DAG.
<p/>
There is an edge <tt>x-&gt;y</tt> between two evaluations <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> if:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>the evaluation <tt>y</tt> observes a value computed by the evaluation <tt>x</tt> or
</p></li>
<li><p>the evaluation <tt>y</tt> is an atomic store, the evaluation <tt>x</tt> is an atomic load, and
there is a condition branch c that may depend (intrathread dependence) on <tt>x</tt>
and <tt>x-sb-&gt;c</tt> and <tt>c-sb-&gt;y</tt>.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
This seems to allow reordering of relaxed atomics that processors do without
extra fence instructions, allows most reorderings by the compiler, and gets
rid of satisfaction cycles.

<p>
(and the usual overload for an explicitly provided comparison function). The standard says nothing about requirements 
in the case where the input type (<tt>iterator_traits&lt;InputIterator&gt;::value_type</tt>) and the output type 
(<tt>iterator_traits&lt;RandomAccessIterator&gt;::value_type</tt>) are different.
<p/>
Presumably the input type must be convertible to the output type. What's less clear is what the requirements are on 
the comparison operator. Does the algorithm only perform comparisons on two values of the output type, or does it also 
perform comparisons on values of the input type, or might it even perform heterogeneous comparisons?

<p>
It compiles without error on my desktop. Is it required to? I can't find evidence from the standard that it is. 
In my test <tt>std::copy</tt> was found by argument-dependent lookup because the implementation I used made 
<tt>std::vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator</tt> a user-defined type defined in namespace <tt>std</tt>. But the standard 
only requires <tt>std::vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator</tt> to be an implementation specified random access iterator 
type. I can't find anything requiring it to be a user-defined type at all (and in fact there are reasonable implementation 
where it isn't), let alone a user defined type defined in a specific namespace.
</p>

<p>
Since the defining namespace of container iterators is visible to users, should the standard say anything about what 
that namespace is?

<p>
In 29.8.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/stringbuf.virtuals">[stringbuf.virtuals]</a>/1, <tt>basic_stringbuf::underflow()</tt> is specified to unconditionally 
return <tt>traits::eof()</tt> when a read position is not available.
<p/>
The semantics of <tt>basic_stringbuf</tt> require, and existing libraries implement it so that this function makes 
a read position available if possible to do so, e.g. if some characters were inserted into the stream since the 
last call to <tt>overflow()</tt>, resulting in <tt>pptr() &gt; egptr()</tt>. Compare to the conceptually similar 
D.8.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/depr.strstreambuf.virtuals">[depr.strstreambuf.virtuals]</a>/15.
</p>

<p><i>[2018-06-06, Billy argues for NAD]</i></p>

<p>
The existing "Any character in the underlying buffer which has been initialized is considered to be part of the input sequence." 
sentence already describes what the <tt>stringbuf</tt> is supposed to do to the get area. The specific mechanism that the 
<tt>stringbuf</tt> uses to alter the get area is unspecified because the mechanism by which the <tt>stringbuf</tt> 
remembers the "high water mark" is unspecified.
<p/>
Consider the following:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
stringstream s;
s &lt;&lt; "Hello";
s.seekp(0);
string x;
s &gt;&gt; x;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Before this P/R, this will store <tt>Hello</tt> in <tt>x</tt>, because the characters <tt>Hello</tt> are initialized. 
After this P/R, the "written put area" is empty, so it will store the empty string in <tt>x</tt>.
<p/>
Saying that the initialized part of the string is used already describes what needs to happen here.

During the acceptance of <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3471.html">N3471</a> and
some similar <tt>constexpr</tt> papers, specific wording was added to <tt>pair</tt>, <tt>tuple</tt>, and other templates
that were intended to impose implementation constraints that ensure that the observable <tt>constexpr</tt> "character"
of a defaulted function template is solely determined by the required expressions of the user-provided types when instantiated,
for example:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The defaulted move and copy constructor, respectively, of pair shall be a <tt>constexpr</tt> function if and only if
all required element-wise initializations for copy and move, respectively, would satisfy the requirements for
a <tt>constexpr</tt> function.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
This wording doesn't require enough, especially since the core language via CWG 1358 does now support <tt>constexpr</tt>
function template instantiations, even if such function cannot appear in a constant expression (as specified in 7.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/expr.const">[expr.const]</a>) 
or as a constant initializer of that object (as specified in  [basic.start.init]). The wording should be 
improved and should require valid uses in constant expressions and as constant initializers instead.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The current library specification uses at several places wording that is intended to refer to
core language template deduction failure at the top-level of expressions (aka "SFINAE"), for example:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The expression <tt>declval&lt;T&gt;() = declval&lt;U&gt;()</tt> is well-formed when treated as an unevaluated operand (Clause 5). 
Access checking is performed as if in a context unrelated to <tt>T</tt> and <tt>U</tt>. Only the validity of the immediate context 
of the assignment expression is considered. [<i>Note:</i> The compilation of the expression can result in side effects 
such as the instantiation of class template specializations and function template specializations, the generation of
implicitly-defined functions, and so on. Such side effects are not in the "immediate context" and can result in the program
being ill-formed. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Similar wording can be found in the specification of <tt>result_of</tt>, <tt>is_constructible</tt>, and <tt>is_convertible</tt>,
being added to resolve an NB comment by LWG <a href="1390">1390</a> and <a href="1391">1391</a> through 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3142.html">N3142</a>.
<p/>
This wording is necessary to limit speculative compilations needed to implement these traits, but it is also lengthy and repetitive.
</p>

<p><i>[2014-05-19, Daniel suggests a descriptive term]</i></p>

<p>
<b>constrictedly well-formed expression</b>:
<p/>
An expression <em>e</em> depending on a set of types <tt>A1</tt>, ..., <tt>An</tt> which is well-formed when treated as 
an unevaluated operand (Clause 5). Access checking is performed as if in a context unrelated to <tt>A1</tt>, ..., 
<tt>An</tt>. Only the validity of the immediate context of <em>e</em> is considered. [<i>Note:</i> The compilation of 
the expression can result in side effects such as the instantiation of class template specializations and function 
template specializations, the generation of implicitly-defined functions, and so on. Such side effects are not in the 
"immediate context" and can result in the program being ill-formed. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p>

<p><i>[2014-05-20, Richard and Jonathan suggest better terms]</i></p>

<p>
Richard suggested "locally well-formed"
<p/>
Jonathan suggested "contextually well-formed" and then "The expression ... is valid in a contrived argument
deduction context"
</p>

<p><i>[2014-06-07, Daniel comments and improves wording]</i></p>

<p>
The 2014-05-19 suggestion did only apply to expressions, but there are two important examples that are not expressions, but instead
are involving an <em>object definition</em> (<tt>std::is_constructible</tt>) and a <em>function definition</em> 
(<tt>std::is_convertible</tt>), respectively, instead. Therefore I suggest to rephrase the usage of "expression" into "program 
construct" in the definition of Jonathan's suggestion of "valid in a contrived argument deduction context".
<p/>
I would like to point out that given the new definition of "valid in a contrived argument deduction context", there are several other 
places of the Library specification that could take advantage of this wording to improve the existing specification, such as 
20.14.16.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/func.wrap.func">[func.wrap.func]</a> p2, most functions in 20.10.9.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/allocator.traits.members">[allocator.traits.members]</a>, and the <tt>**Insertable</tt>, 
<tt>EmplaceConstructible</tt>, and <tt>Erasable</tt> definitions in 22.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a>, but given that
these are not fully described in terms of the aforementioned wording <em>yet</em>, I would recommend to fix them by a separate issue 
once the committee has agreed on following the suggestion presented by this issue.

<p><i>[2015-05-05 Lenexa: Move to Open]</i></p>

<p>MC: I think we like the direction but it isn't quite right: it needs some work</p>
<p>JW: I'm prepared to volunteer to move that further, hopefully with the help of Daniel</p>
<p>Roger Orr: should this be Core wording because it doesn't really have anything to do with libraries - the term could then just be used here</p>
<p>AM: Core has nothing to deal with that, though</p>
<p>HT: it seems there is nothing to imply that allows dropping out with an error - maybe that's a separate issue</p>

<p>
The library gives explicit permission in 16.5.4.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/namespace.std">[namespace.std]</a> p2 that user code may explicitly instantiate
a library template provided that the instantiations depend on at least one user-defined type:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
A program may explicitly instantiate a template defined in the standard library only if the declaration
depends on the name of a user-defined type and the instantiation meets the standard library requirements
for the original template.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
But it seems that the C++11 library is not specified in a way that guarantees such an instantiation to be well-formed
if the minimum requirements of the library is not satisfied. 
<p/>
For example, in general, the first template parameter of <tt>std::vector</tt> is not required to be 
<tt>DefaultConstructible</tt> in general, but due to the split of the single C++03 member function
with default argument
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void resize(size_type sz, T c = T());
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
into
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void resize(size_type sz);
void resize(size_type sz, const T&amp; c);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
the effect is now that for a type <tt>ND</tt> that is not <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>, such as
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct NP { 
  NP(int); 
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
the explicit instantiation of <tt>std::vector&lt;ND&gt;</tt> is no longer well-formed, because the attempt to
instantiate the single-argument overload of <tt>resize</tt> cannot not succeed, because this function imposes
the <tt>DefaultInsertable</tt> requirements and given the default allocator this effectively requires
<tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>.
</p>
<p>
But <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt> is not the only point, what about <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> versus
<tt>MoveConstructible</tt> alone? It turns out that currently the second <tt>resize</tt> overload
would fail during an explicit instantiation for a type like
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct MO { 
  MO() = default; 
  MO(MO&amp;&amp;) = default; 
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
because it imposes <tt>CopyInsertable</tt> requirements that end up being equivalent to the <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>
requirements for the default allocator.
<p/>
Technically a library can solve these issues: For special member functions by defining them in some base class, for others
by transforming them effectively into a function template due to the great feature of default template arguments for
function templates (At the very moment the validity of the latter approach depends on a resolution of core language issue
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_active.html#1635">CWG 1635</a>, though). E.g. the here mentioned 
<tt>resize</tt> functions of <tt>std::vector</tt> could be prevented from instantiation by defining them like this 
with an implementation:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class = void&gt;
void resize(size_type sz) { [&hellip;] }
template&lt;class = void&gt;
void resize(size_type sz, const T&amp; c) { [&hellip;] }
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In this case, these functions could also be defined in a base class, but the latter approach won't work in all cases.
<p/>
Basically such an implementation is required to constrain all member functions that are not covered by the general
requirements imposed on the actual library template parameters. I tested three different C++11 library implementations
and but none could instantiate for example <tt>std::list</tt>, <tt>std::vector</tt>, or <tt>std::deque</tt> with
value types that are not <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt> or only <tt>MoveConstructible</tt>. 
<p/>

<p/>
This issue is raised to clarify the current situation in regard to the actual requirements imposed on user-provided
types that are used to explicitly instantiate Library-provided templates. For example, the current Container requirements
impose very little requirements on the actual value type and it is unclear to which extend library implementations have
to respect that. 
<p/>
The minimum solution of this issue should be to at least realize that there is no fundamental requirement on 
<tt>DefaultConstructible</tt> for value types of library containers, because we have since C++03 the general
statement of 16.5.3.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/utility.arg.requirements">[utility.arg.requirements]</a> ("In general, a default constructor is not required.").
It is unclear whether <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> should be required for an explicit instantiation request, but
given the careful introduction of move operations in the library it would seem astonishing that a
<tt>MoveConstructible</tt> type wouldn't suffice for value types of the container types.
<p/>
In any case I can envision at least two approaches to solve this issue:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
As indicated in LWG <a href="2292">2292</a>, those function could get an explicit "<i>Template Constraints:</i>"
element, albeit this promises more than needed to solve this issue.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The library could introduce a completely new element form, such as "<i>Instantiation Constraints:</i>" that
would handle this situation for explicit instantiation situations. This would allow for simpler techniques
to solve the issue when explicit instantiation is required compared to the first bullet, because it would not 
(necessarily) guarantee SFINAE-friendly expression-wellformedness, such as inspecting the expression 
<tt>std::declval&lt;std::vector&lt;ND&gt;&amp;&gt;.resize(0)</tt> in an unevaluated context.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
It should be noted that the 2013-08-27 comment to LWG <a href="2193">2193</a> could be resolved by a similar solution
as indicated in this issue here.

22.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a>/10 says that unless otherwise specified, "no <tt>swap()</tt> function invalidates 
any references, pointers, or iterators referring to the elements of the containers being swapped. [<i>Note:</i> The <tt>end()</tt>

assignment operators aren't given similar invalidation guarantees. The guarantees need several exceptions, so I do not believe 
that blanket language like /11 "Unless otherwise specified (either explicitly or by defining a function in terms of other functions), 
invoking a container member function or passing a container as an argument to a library function shall not invalidate iterators to, 
or change the values of, objects within that container." is applicable.

The table in 30.5.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.synopt">[re.synopt]</a>/1 says that <tt>regex_constants::collate</tt> "Specifies that character ranges of the form

too.

</p>

<p><i>[2014-5-14, John Maddock response]</i></p>

<p>
The original intention was the original wording: namely that <tt>collate</tt> only made character ranges locale sensitive.  
To be frank it's a feature that's probably hardly ever used (though I have no real hard data on that), and is a leftover 
from early POSIX standards which <em>required</em> locale sensitive collation for character ranges, and then later changed 
to implementation defined if I remember correctly (basically nobody implemented locale-dependent collation).
<p/>
So I guess the question is do we gain anything by requiring all character-comparisons to go through the locale when this bit 
is set? Certainly it adds a great deal to the implementation effort (it's not what Boost.Regex has ever done). I guess the 
question is are differing code-points that collate identically an important use case? I guess there might be a few Unicode 
code points that do that, but I don't know how to go about verifying that.
<p/>
STL:
<p/>
If this was unintentional, then 30.5.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.synopt">[re.synopt]</a>/1's table should be left alone, while 30.13 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.grammar">[re.grammar]</a>/14 
should be changed instead.
<p/>
Jeffrey Yasskin:
<p/>
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/tr18-13.html#Tailored_Loose_Matches">This page</a>
mentions that [V] in Swedish should match "W" in a perfect world.
<p/>
However, the most recent version of <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Tailored_Loose_Matches">TR18</a> retracts
both language-specific loose matches <em>and</em> language-specific ranges
because "for most full-featured regular expression engines, it is
quite difficult to match under code point equivalences that are not
1:1" and "tailored ranges can be quite difficult to implement
properly, and can have very unexpected results in practice. For
example, languages may also vary whether they consider lowercase below
uppercase or the reverse. This can have some surprising results: [a-Z]
may not match anything if <tt>Z &lt; a</tt> in that locale."
<p/>
<a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.10.2.15">ECMAScript</a> doesn't include collation at all.
<p/>
IMO, +1 to changing 28.13 instead of 28.5.1. It seems like we'd be on
fairly solid ground if we wanted to remove <tt>regex_constants::collate</tt>
entirely, in favor of named character classes, but of course that's
not for this issue.

<h3><a name="2334" href="2334">2334.</a> <tt>atomic</tt>'s default constructor requires "uninitialized" state even for types with non-trivial default-constructor</h3>

According to 99 [atomics.types.operations.req] p4,
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
A ::A () noexcept = default;
</pre><blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects:</i> leaves the atomic object in an uninitialized state. [<i>Note:</i> These semantics ensure compatibility
with <tt>C</tt>. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
This implementation requirement is OK for POD types, like <tt>int</tt>, but 31.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.types.generic">[atomics.types.generic]</a> p1
intentionally allows template arguments of <tt>atomic</tt> with a non-trivial default constructor ("The type of the template argument
<tt>T</tt> shall be trivially copyable (3.9)"), so this wording can be read in a way that makes the behaviour of the following code
undefined:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;atomic&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct S {
  S() noexcept : v(42) {}
  int v;
};

int main() {
  std::atomic&lt;S&gt; as; // Default-initialization
  std::cout &lt;&lt; as.load().v &lt;&lt; std::endl; // ?
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
For a user-defined emulation of <tt>atomic</tt> the expected outcome would be defined and the program would output "42",
but existing implementations differ and the result value is a "random number" for at least one implementation. This seems
very surprising to me.
<p/>
To realize that seemingly existing requirement, an implementation is either required to violate normal language rules internally
or to perform specific bit-randomization-techniques after the normal default-initialization that called the default constructor
of <tt>S</tt>.
<p/>
According to my understanding, the non-normative note in 99 [atomics.types.operations.req] p4 is intended to
refer to types that are valid <tt>C</tt>-types, but the example type <tt>S</tt> is not such a type.
<p/>
To make the mental model of <tt>atomic</tt>'s default constructor more intuitive for user-code, I suggest to clarify the wording
to have the effects of default-initialization instead. The current state seems more like an unintended effect of imprecise
language used here and has some similarities to wording that was incorrectly used to specify <tt>atomic_flag</tt> initialization
as described by LWG <a href="2159">2159</a>.
</p>

<p><i>[2014-05-17, Daniel comments and provides alternative wording]</i></p>


<p>
The current wording was considered controversial as expressed by reflector discussions. To me, the actual problem is not newly
introduced by that wording, but instead is already present in basically all paragraphs specifying semantics of atomic types,
since the wording never clearly distinguishes the value of the actual atomic type <i>A</i> and the value of the "underlying",
corresponding non-atomic type <i>C</i>. The revised proposed wording attempts to improve the current ambiguity of these two
kinds of values.

<p>SG1 also reviewed another PR from Lawrence Crowl. Lawrence's feedback was that turning atomic&lt;T&gt; into a container of T was a mistake, even if we allow the implementation of atomic to contain a T. SG1 agreed with Lawrence, but his PR (<a href="http://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21toronto2017/DefaultInitNonContainer">http://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21toronto2017/DefaultInitNonContainer</a>) had massive merge conflicts caused by the adoption of P0558. Billy O'Neal supplied a new PR, which SG1 agreed to and which LWG looked at informally. This change also makes it clearer that initialization of an atomic is not an atomic operation in all forms, changes the C compatibility example to actually be compatible with C, and removes "initialization-compatible" which is not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>SG1 considered moving <tt>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</tt> into Annex D, as their understanding at this time is that WG14 is considering removal of that macro. However, consensus was that moving things between clauses would require a paper, and that we should wait to remove that until WG14 actually does so.</p>

<p>
In order to replace some uses of C arrays with <tt>std::array</tt>, we need it
to be possible to cast from a <tt>std::array&lt;&gt;</tt> to an equivalent C array.
Core wording doesn't appear to be in quite the right state to allow
casting, but if we specify that appropriate types are
layout-compatible, we can at least write:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
union {
  array&lt;array&lt;array&lt;int, 2&gt;, 3&gt;, 4&gt; arr;
  int carr[4][3][2];
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
to view memory as the other type: C++14 CD [class.mem]p18.
</p>
I believe it's sufficient to add "<tt>array&lt;T, N&gt;</tt> shall be
layout-compatible (6.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/basic.types">[basic.types]</a>) with <tt>T[N]</tt>." to 
22.3.7.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/array.overview">[array.overview]</a>, but we might also need some extension to 
11.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/class.mem">[class.mem]</a> to address the possibility of layout-compatibility 
between struct and array types.
<p>
I checked that libc++ on MacOS already implements this, although it
would be good for someone else to double-check; I haven't checked any
other standard libraries.

30.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.traits">[re.traits]</a>/7, begins with "if <tt>typeid(use_facet&lt;collate&lt;charT&gt; &gt;) == typeid(collate_byname&lt;charT&gt;)</tt>", 
which appears to be pseudocode with the intention to convey that the collate facet has not been replaced by the user. Cf. the wording in 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2003/n1429.htm">N1429</a> "there is no portable way to implement 
<tt>transform_primary</tt> in terms of <tt>std::locale</tt>, since even if the sort key format returned by 
<tt>std::collate_byname&lt;&gt;::transform</tt> is known and can be converted into a primary sort key, the user can still 
install their own custom <tt>std::collate</tt> implementation into the locale object used, and that can use any sort key 
format they see fit.".
<p/>
Taken literally, 30.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.traits">[re.traits]</a>/7 appears to imply that named locales are required to hold their collate facets with 
dynamic type <tt>std::collate_byname&lt;charT&gt;</tt>, which is in fact true in some implementations (e.g libc++), but not others 
(e.g. libstdc++). This does not follow from the description of <tt>_byname</tt> in 28.3.1.1.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/locale.facet">[locale.facet]</a>/4, which is only 
required to provide equivalent semantics, to the named locale's facet, not to actually be one.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
For wide streams argument types <tt>wchar_t const*</tt> and <tt>wchar_t</tt> are supported only as template parameters. 
User defined conversions are not considered for template parameter matching. Hence inappropriate overloads of 
<tt>operator&lt;&lt;</tt> are selected when an implicit conversion is required for the argument, which is inconsistent 
with the behavior for <tt>char const*</tt> and <tt>char</tt>, is unexpected, and is a useless result.
<p/>
Demonstration:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct Byte_string
{ 
  operator char const*() const { return "Hurray, it works!"; } 
};

struct Wide_string
{ 
  operator wchar_t const*() const { return L"Hurray, it works!"; } 
};

struct Byte_ch
{ 
  operator char() const { return 'X'; } 
};

struct Wide_ch
{ 
  operator wchar_t() const { return L'X'; } 
};

auto main() -> int
{
  using namespace std;
  wcout &lt;&lt; "'X' as char value   : " &lt;&lt; Byte_ch() &lt;&lt; endl;
  wcout &lt;&lt; "'X' as wchar_t value: " &lt;&lt; Wide_ch() &lt;&lt; endl;
  wcout &lt;&lt; "Byte string pointer : " &lt;&lt; Byte_string() &lt;&lt; endl;
  wcout &lt;&lt; "Wide string pointer : " &lt;&lt; Wide_string() &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Example output:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
'X' as char value   : X
'X' as wchar_t value: 88
Byte string pointer : Hurray, it works!
Wide string pointer : 000803C8

Example: <tt>char16_t('1') != u'1'</tt> is possible.
<p/>
The numeric value of <tt>char16_t</tt> is defined to be Unicode
code point, which is same to the ASCII value and UTF-8 for
7-bit chars.  However, <tt>char</tt> is not guaranteed to have an
encoding which is compatible with ASCII. For example, <tt>'1'</tt> in EBCDIC is 241.
<p/>
I found three places in the standard casting narrow char
literals: <tt>bitset::bitset</tt>, <tt>bitset::to_string</tt> and <tt>quoted</tt>.
<p/>
PJ confirmed this issue and says he has a solution used
in their <tt>&lt;filesystem&gt;</tt> implementation, and he may want to
propose it to the standard.
<p/>
The solution in my mind, for now, is to make those default
arguments magical, where the "magic" can be implemented
with a C11 <tt>_Generic</tt> selection (works in clang):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#define _G(T, literal) _Generic(T{}, \

      char16_t: u ## literal, \

  _G(char16_t, '1') == u'1'

<p>
The formatted input function requirement says in 29.7.4.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/istream.formatted.reqmts">[istream.formatted.reqmts]</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"If an exception is thrown during input then <tt>ios::badbit</tt> is turned on
in <tt>*this</tt>'s error state.  If <tt>(exceptions()&amp;badbit) != 0</tt> then the exception
is rethrown."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
while some formatted function may throw an exception from <tt>basic_ios::clear</tt>, for example
in 20.9.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/bitset.operators">[bitset.operators]</a> p6:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"If no characters are stored in <tt>str</tt>, calls <tt>is.setstate(ios_base::failbit)</tt> (which may 
throw <tt>ios_base::failure</tt>)"
</p></blockquote>
<p>
So should this exception be considered as "an exception [...] thrown
during input"?  And here is an implementation divergence (or you
can read the following as "a bug libc++ only has" :)
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
cin.exceptions(ios_base::failbit);
bitset&lt;N&gt; b;
try {
  cin &gt;&gt; b;  // type 'a' and return
} catch (...)
{}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Now <tt>cin.rdstate()</tt> is just <tt>failbit</tt> in libstdc++ (and Dinkumware, by
PJ), but <tt>failbit &amp; badbit</tt> libc++. Similar difference found in other
places, like <tt>eofbit &amp; badbid</tt> after <tt>std::getline</tt>.
<p/>
PJ and Matt both agree that the intention (of <tt>badbit</tt> + rethrow) is
"to signify an exception arising in user code, not the iostreams package".
<p/>
In addition, I found the following words in unformatted input
function's requirements (29.7.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/istream.unformatted">[istream.unformatted]</a>):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If an exception is thrown during input then <tt>ios::badbit</tt> is turned on
in <tt>*this</tt>'s error state. (Exceptions thrown from <tt>basic_ios&lt;&gt;::clear()</tt>
are not caught or rethrown.)  If <tt>(exceptions()&amp;badbit) != 0</tt> then the
exception is rethrown.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The content within the parenthesis is added by LWG defect <a href="61">61</a>,
and does fix the ambiguity. However, it only fixed the 1 of 4
requirements, and it lost some context (the word "rethrown" is not
seen before this sentence within this section).

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The 'Condition' for <tt>std::is_empty</tt> is listed as:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"<tt>T</tt> is a class type, but not a union type, with no non-static data members other than bit-fields of length 0, 
no virtual member functions, no virtual base classes, and no base class <tt>B</tt> for which <tt>is_empty&lt;B&gt;::value</tt> 
is false."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is incorrect: there is no such thing as a non-static data member that is a bit-field of length 0, since bit-fields of 
length 0 must be unnamed, and unnamed bit-fields are not members (see 11.3.9 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/class.bit">[class.bit]</a> p2).
<p/>
It also means that classes such as:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct S {
 int : 3;
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
are empty (because they have no non-static data members). There's implementation divergence on the value of 
<tt>is_empty&lt;S&gt;::value</tt>.
<p/>
I'm not sure what the purpose of <tt>is_empty</tt> is (or how it could be useful), but if it's desirable for the above type to 
not be treated as empty, something like this could work:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"<tt>T</tt> is a class type, but not a union type, with no non-static data members <del>other than</del><ins>, no unnamed</ins> 
bit-fields of <ins>non-zero</ins> length <del>0</del>, no virtual member functions, no virtual base classes, and no base class 
<tt>B</tt> for which <tt>is_empty&lt;B&gt;::value</tt> is false."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
and if the above type <em>should</em> be treated as empty, then this might be appropriate:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"<tt>T</tt> is a class type, but not a union type, with no <ins>(named)</ins> non-static data members <del>other than bit-fields of 
length 0</del>, no virtual member functions, no virtual base classes, and no base class <tt>B</tt> for which 
<tt>is_empty&lt;B&gt;::value</tt> is false."

</p></blockquote>

<p>
However, we occasionally find code of the form:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
std::unique_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; p(new Foo);
auto res = m.emplace("foo", std::move(p));
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
where we'd like to avoid destroying the <tt>Foo</tt> if the insertion doesn't
take place (if the container already had an element with the specified key).
<p/>
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3873">N3873</a> includes
a partial solution to this in the form of a new <tt>emplace_stable</tt> member function, but LEWG's 
discussion strongly agreed that we'd rather have <tt>emplace()</tt> Just Work:
<p/>
Should <tt>map::emplace()</tt> be guaranteed not to move/copy its arguments if the insertion doesn't happen?
<p/>
SF: 8 F: 3 N: 0 A: 0 SA: 0
<p/>
This poll was marred by the fact that we didn't notice or call out
that <tt>emplace()</tt> must construct the key before doing the lookup, and it
must not then move the key after it determines whether an insert is
going to happen, and the <tt>mapped_type</tt> instance must live next to the key.
<p/>
The very similar issue <a href="2006">2006</a> was previously marked NAD, with
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3178.htm">N3178</a> as
discussion. However, given LEWG's interest in the alternate behavior,
we should reopen the question in this issue.
<p/>
We will need a paper that describes how to implement this before we can make more progress.

</p>
<blockquote><p> The class <tt>shared_timed_mutex</tt> shall satisfy all of the 
<tt>SharedTimedMutex</tt> requirements (30.4.1.4). It shall be a standard layout class (Clause 9).
</p></blockquote> 
<p>
There's no <tt>SharedTimedMutex</tt> requirements; this name doesn't appear anywhere else in the standard. (Prior to N3891, 
this was <tt>SharedMutex</tt>, which was equally undefined.)
<p/>
I assume this concept should be defined somewhere?
<p/>
Also, n3891 changes 32.4.3.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.sharedtimedmutex.requirements">[thread.sharedtimedmutex.requirements]</a> from defining "shared mutex type" to defining 
"shared timed mutex type", but its paragraph 2 still talks about "shared mutex type". Is that OK? I think you could argue 
that it's clear enough what it means, but presumably it should use the term that paragraph 1 defined.
<p/>
32.4.4.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.lock.shared">[thread.lock.shared]</a> paragraph 1 talks about the "shared mutex requirements", which again is a term that isn't 
defined, and presumably means "the requirements on a shared timed mutex type" or similar (maybe if <tt>SharedMutex</tt> or 
<tt>SharedTimedMutex</tt> were defined it could be reused here).
</p>

<p><i>[2014-05-22, Daniel comments]</i></p>

<p>
As for <tt>SharedTimedMutex</tt>, there exists a similar problem in regard to <tt>TimedMutex</tt> referred to in
32.4.3.3.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.timedmutex.class">[thread.timedmutex.class]</a> p2 and in 32.4.3.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.timedmutex.recursive">[thread.timedmutex.recursive]</a> p2, but nowhere defined.
<p/>
Another problem is, that according to 32.4.3.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.mutex.class">[thread.mutex.class]</a> p3, "The class <tt>mutex</tt> shall satisfy all the 
<tt>Mutex</tt> requirements (32.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.mutex.requirements">[thread.mutex.requirements]</a>).", but there are no concrete <tt>Mutex</tt> requirements,
32.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.mutex.requirements">[thread.mutex.requirements]</a> &mdash; titled as "Mutex requirements" &mdash; describes <em>mutex types</em>,
<em>timed mutex types</em>, and <em>shared timed mutex types</em>.
</p>

<p><i>[2014-06-08, Daniel comments and provides wording]</i></p>

<p>
The presented wording adds to the existing <em>mutex types</em>, <em>timed mutex types</em>, and <em>shared timed mutex types</em> 
terms a new set of corresponding <tt>MutexType</tt>, <tt>TimedMutexType</tt>, and <tt>SharedTimedMutexType</tt> requirements. 
<p/>
The reason for the change of requirement names is two-fold: First, the new name better matches the intention to have a concrete 
name for the requirements imposed on the corresponding <em>mutex types</em> (This kind of requirement deviate from the more general
<tt>Lockable</tt> requirements, which are not restricted to a explicitly enumerated set of library types). Second, using 
<tt>**MutexType</tt> over <tt>**Mutex</tt> provides the additional advantage that it reduces the chances of confusing named 
requirements from template parameters named <tt>Mutex</tt> (such as for <tt>unique_lock</tt> or <tt>shared_lock</tt>).
<p/>
Nonetheless the here presented wording has one unfortunate side-effect: Once applied it would have the effect that types
used to instantiate <tt>std::shared_lock</tt> cannot be user-defined shared mutex types due to 32.4.4.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.lock.shared">[thread.lock.shared]</a>. 
The reason is based on the currently lack of an existing <tt>SharedLockable</tt> requirement set, which would complete the 
existing <tt>BasicLockable</tt> and <tt>Lockable</tt> requirements (which are "real" requirements). This restriction is not
actually a problem introduced by the provided resolution but instead one that existed before but becomes more obvious now.

<p>
SG1 hands this over to LWG for wording review
</p>

<p><i>[2015-10-21 Kona, Daniel comments and adjusts wording to to untimed shared mutex types]</i></p>

<p>
The new wording reflects the addition of the new shared mutex types. The approach used for <tt>shared_lock</tt>
is similar to the one used for <tt>unique_lock</tt>: The template argument <tt>Mutex</tt> has a reduced requirement set that is not
sufficient for <em>all</em> operations. Only those members that require stronger requirements of <tt>SharedTimedMutexType</tt>
specify that additionally in the <i>Requires</i> element of the corresponding prototype specifications.
<p/>
The proposed wording could be more general if we would introduce more fundamental requirements set for <tt>SharedLockable</tt>
and <tt>SharedTimedLockable</tt> types which could be satisfied by user-provided types as well, because the 
<tt>SharedMutexType</tt> and <tt>SharedTimedMutexType</tt> requirements are essentially restricted to an enumerated set of
types provided by the Standard Library. But this extension seemed too large for this issue and can be easily fixed later
without any harm.

<p>
Given the following code,
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;sstream&gt;

std::stringbuf buf;
std::istreambuf_iterator&lt;char&gt; begin(&amp;buf);
std::istreambuf_iterator&lt;char&gt; end;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
it is not clear from the wording of the Standard whether <tt>begin.equal(end)</tt>
must be true. In at least one implementation it is not (CC: Sun C++ 5.10 SunOS_sparc Patch 128228-25 2013/02/20) and in at least
one implementation it is (gcc version 4.3.2 x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu).
<p/>
23.6.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/istreambuf.iterator">[istreambuf.iterator]</a> says that <tt>end</tt> is an end-of-stream iterator since it was default
constructed. It also says that an iterator becomes equal to an end-of-stream
iterator when end of stream is reached by <tt>sgetc()</tt> having returned <tt>eof()</tt>.
99 [istreambuf.iterator::equal] says that <tt>equal()</tt> returns true iff both iterators are end of stream
or not end of stream. But there seems to be no requirement that <tt>equal</tt> check for end-of-stream by calling <tt>sgetc()</tt>. 
<p/>
Jiahan Zi at BloombergLP discovered this issue through his code failing to
work correctly. Dietmar K&uuml;hl has opined in a private communication that
the iterators should compare equal.

<p>
23.3.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.requirements.general">[iterator.requirements.general]</a> p9 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Destruction of an iterator may invalidate pointers and references previously obtained from that iterator.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But the resolution of LWG issue <a href="2360">2360</a> specifically advocates returning <tt>*--temp;</tt> where <tt>temp</tt> is a 
local variable.
<p/>
And 23.3.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/forward.iterators">[forward.iterators]</a> p6 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are both dereferenceable, then <tt>a == b</tt> if and only if <tt>*a</tt> and <tt>*b</tt> are bound 
to the same object.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
which disallows "stashing" iterators (i.e, iterators that refer to data inside themselves).
<p/>
So, I suspect that the restriction in p9 should only apply to input iterators, and can probably be moved into 
23.3.5.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/input.iterators">[input.iterators]</a> instead of 23.3.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.requirements.general">[iterator.requirements.general]</a>.
</p>

<p><i>[2014-05-22, Daniel comments]</i></p>


<p>
Given that forward iterators (and beyond) are refinements of input iterator, moving this constraint to input iterators won't help
much because it would still hold for all refined forms.

In 28.4.2.1.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/facet.num.get.virtuals">[facet.num.get.virtuals]</a> we have:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Stage 3: The sequence of chars accumulated in stage 2 (the field) is converted to a numeric value by the
rules of one of the functions declared in the header <tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt>:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For a signed integer value, the function <tt>strtoll</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>For an unsigned integer value, the function <tt>strtoull</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>For a floating-point value, the function <tt>strtold</tt>.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
This implies that for many cases, this routine should return true:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
bool is_same(const char* p) 
{
  std::string str{p};
  double val1 = std::strtod(str.c_str(), nullptr);
  std::stringstream ss(str);
  double val2;
  ss &gt;&gt; val2;
  return std::isinf(val1) == std::isinf(val2) &amp;&amp;                 // either they're both infinity
         std::isnan(val1) == std::isnan(val2) &amp;&amp;                 // or they're both NaN
         (std::isinf(val1) || std::isnan(val1) || val1 == val2); // or they're equal
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
and this is indeed true, for many strings:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
assert(is_same("0"));
assert(is_same("1.0"));
assert(is_same("-1.0"));
assert(is_same("100.123"));
assert(is_same("1234.456e89"));
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
but not for others
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
assert(is_same("0xABp-4")); // hex float
assert(is_same("inf"));
assert(is_same("+inf"));
assert(is_same("-inf"));
assert(is_same("nan"));
assert(is_same("+nan"));
assert(is_same("-nan"));

assert(is_same("infinity"));
assert(is_same("+infinity"));
assert(is_same("-infinity"));
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
These are all strings that are correctly parsed by <tt>std::strtod</tt>, but not by the stream extraction operators.
They contain characters that are deemed invalid in stage 2 of parsing.
<p/>
If we're going to say that we're converting by the rules of <tt>strtold</tt>, then we should accept all the things that 
<tt>strtold</tt> accepts.

<p>
People are much more interested in round-tripping hex floats than handling <tt>inf</tt> and <tt>nan</tt>. Priority changed to P2.

Marshall says he'll try to write some wording, noting that this is a very closely specified part of the standard, and has remained unchanged for a long time. Also, there will need to be a sample implementation.

<p>Zhihao provides wording</p>
<p>The <tt>src</tt> array in Stage 2 does narrowing only.  The actual
input validation is delegated to <tt>strtold</tt> (independent from
the parsing in Stage 3 which is again being delegated
to <tt>strtold</tt>) by saying:</p>

<p>  [...] If it is not discarded, then a check is made to determine
  if c is allowed as the next character of an input field of the
  conversion specifier returned by Stage 1.</p>

<p>So a conforming C++11 <tt>num_get</tt> is supposed to magically
accept an hexfloat without an exponent</p>

<p>  0x3.AB</p>

<p>because we refers to C99, and the fix to this issue should be
just expanding the <tt>src</tt> array.</p>

<p>Support for Infs and NaNs are not proposed because of the

<p>
<tt>type_info</tt>'s destructor is depicted as being <tt>virtual</tt>, which is nearly unobservable to users (since they can't construct 
or copy this class, they can't usefully derive from it). However, it's technically observable (via <tt>is_polymorphic</tt> and 
<tt>has_virtual_destructor</tt>). It also imposes real costs on implementations, requiring them to store one vptr per 
<tt>type_info</tt> object, when RTTI space consumption is a significant concern.
<p/>
Making this implementation-defined wouldn't affect users (who can observe this only if they're specifically looking for it) and 
wouldn't affect implementations who need <tt>virtual</tt> here, but it would allow other implementations to drop <tt>virtual</tt> 
and improve their RTTI space consumption.
<p/>
Richard Smith:
<p/>
It's observable in a few other ways.

<p>
... is broken by this change, because you can't <tt>dynamic_cast</tt> a non-polymorphic class type to <tt>void*</tt>.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
type_info&amp; f();
typeid(f());
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
... evaluates <tt>f()</tt> at runtime without this change, and might not do so with this change.
<p/>
These are probably rare things, but I can imagine at least some forms of the latter being used in SFINAE tricks.

When <tt>NDEBUG</tt> is defined, <tt>assert</tt> must expand exactly to the token sequence <tt>((void)0)</tt>, with no 
whitespace (C99 &sect;7.2/1 and also C11 &sect;7.2/1). This is a lost opportunity to pass the condition along to the optimizer.
<p/>
The user may observe the token sequence using the stringize operator or discriminate it by making a matching <tt>#define</tt> 
directive. There is little chance of practical code doing such things. It's reasonable to allow any expansion that is a <tt>void</tt> 
expression with no side effects or semantic requirements, for example, an extension keyword or an attribute-specifier finagled 
into the context.
<p/>
Conforming optimizations would still be limited to treating the condition as hint, not a requirement. Nonconformance on this 
point is quite reasonable though, given user preferences. Anyway, it shouldn't depend on preprocessor quirks.
<p/>
As for current practice, Darwin OS <tt>&lt;assert.h&gt;</tt> provides a GCC-style compiler hint <tt>__builtin_expect</tt> but only in 
debug mode. Shouldn't release mode preserve hints?

N3936 16.5.5.8 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/reentrancy">[reentrancy]</a>/1 talks about "functions", but that doesn't address the scenario of calling different member 
functions of a single object. Member functions often have to violate and then re-establish invariants. For example, vectors 
often have "holes" during insertion, and element constructors/destructors/etc. shouldn't be allowed to observe the vector 
while it's in this invariant-violating state. The [reentrancy] Standardese should be extended to cover member functions, 
so that implementers can either say that member function reentrancy is universally prohibited, or selectively allowed for 
very specific scenarios.

<p>
The specification of <tt>std::align</tt> does not appear to specify what happens when the value of the <tt>size</tt> 
parameter is 0. (The question of what happens when <tt>alignment</tt> is 0 is mentioned in another Defect Report, <a href="2377">2377</a>; 
it would change the behavior to be undefined rather than potentially implementation-defined.)
<p/>
The case of <tt>size</tt> being 0 is interesting because the result is ambiguous. Consider the following code's output:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;

int main()
{
  alignas(8) char buffer[8];
  void *ptr = &amp;buffer[1];
  std::size_t space = sizeof(buffer) - sizeof(char[1]);

  void *result = std::align(8, 0, ptr, space);

  std::printf("%d %td\n", !!result, result ? (static_cast&lt;char*&gt;(result) - buffer) : std::ptrdiff_t(-1));
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are four straightforward answers as to what the behavior of <tt>std::align</tt> with size 0 should be:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The behavior is undefined because the size is invalid.</p></li>
<li><p>The behavior is implementation-defined. This seems to be the status quo, with current implementations using #3.</p></li>
<li><p>Act the same as <tt>size == 1</tt>, except that if <tt>size == 1</tt> would fail but would be defined and succeed 
if space were exactly 1 larger, the result is a pointer to the byte past the end of the <tt>ptr</tt> buffer. That is, the 
"aligned" version of a 0-byte object can be one past the end of an allocation. Such pointers are, of course, valid when not 
dereferenced (and a "0-byte object" shouldn't be), but whether that is desired is not specified in the Standard's definition 
of <tt>std::align</tt>, it appears. The output of the code sample is "<tt>1 8</tt>" in this case.</p></li>
<li><p>Act the same as <tt>size == 1</tt>; this means that returning "one past the end" is not a possible result. In this case, 
the code sample's output is "<tt>0 -1</tt>".</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
The two compilers I could get working with <tt>std::align</tt>, Visual Studio 2013 and Clang 3.4, implement #3. (Change <tt>%td</tt> to 
<tt>%Id</tt> on Visual Studio 2013 and earlier. 2014 and later will have <tt>%td</tt>.)

<p>
The requirements on the traits class in 30.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.req">[re.req]</a> do not say whether a
regular expression traits class is required to be <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>, 
<tt>CopyConstructible</tt>, <tt>CopyAssignable</tt> etc.
<p/>
The <tt>std::regex_traits</tt> class appears to be all of the above, but can
<tt>basic_regex</tt> assume that for user-defined traits classes?
<p/>
Should the following statements all leave <tt>u</tt> in equivalent states?
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
X u{v};
X u; u = v;
X u; u.imbue(v.getloc();
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Whether they are equivalent has implications for <tt>basic_regex</tt> copy construction and 
assignment.

The <tt>BaseCharacteristic</tt> for <tt>is_constructible</tt> is defined in terms of the well-formedness 
of a declaration for an invented variable. The well-formedness of the described declaration itself may 
change for the same set of arguments because of the introduction of default arguments.
<p/>
In the following program, there appears to be conflicting definitions of a specialization of 
<tt>std::is_constructible</tt>; however, it seems that this situation is caused without a user violation 
of the library requirements or the ODR. There is a similar issue with <tt>is_convertible</tt>, <tt>result_of</tt>
and others.
<p/>
a.cc:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;type_traits&gt;
struct A { A(int, int); };
const std::false_type&amp; x1 = std::is_constructible&lt;A, int&gt;();

int main() { }
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
b.cc:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>

<p>
Presumably this program should invoke undefined behaviour, but the Library specification doesn't
say that.

<p>
When resizing a <tt>vector</tt>, the accessibility and exception specification of the value type's 
constructors determines whether the elements are copied or moved to the new buffer.
However, the copy/move is performed via the allocator's <tt>construct</tt> member function, which is 
assumed, but not required, to call the copy/move constructor and propagate only exceptions 
from the value type's copy/move constructor. The issue might also affect other classes. 
<p/>
The current wording in N4296 relevant here is from Table 28 &mdash; "Allocator requirements" in 
16.5.3.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/allocator.requirements">[allocator.requirements]</a>: 
</p>

<p>
and from 16.5.3.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/allocator.requirements">[allocator.requirements]</a> p9:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
An allocator may constrain the types on which it can be instantiated and the arguments for which its
<tt>construct</tt> member may be called. If a type cannot be used with a particular allocator, the allocator class
or the call to <tt>construct</tt> may fail to instantiate.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I conclude the following from the wording:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The allocator is not required to call the copy constructor if the
arguments (args) is a single (potentially const) lvalue of the value
type. Similarly for a non-const rvalue + move constructor. See also
22.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a> p15 which seems to try to require
this, but is not sufficient:
That paragraph specifies the semantics of the allocator's operations,
but not which constructors of the value type are used, if any.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>The allocator may throw exceptions in addition to the exceptions propagated by
the constructors of the value type; it can also propagate exceptions from constructors
other than a copy/move constructor.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This leads to an issue with the wording of the exception safety guarantees for vector modifiers in
22.3.11.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/vector.modifiers">[vector.modifiers]</a> p1:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[&hellip;]
</p>
<pre>
void push_back(const T&amp; x);
void push_back(T&amp;&amp; x);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Remarks</i>: Causes reallocation if the new size is greater than the old capacity. If no 
reallocation happens, all the iterators and references before the insertion point remain valid. 
If an exception is thrown other than by the copy constructor, move constructor, assignment 
operator, or move assignment operator of <tt>T</tt> or by any InputIterator operation there are 
no effects.
<span  style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bold">
If an exception is thrown while inserting a single element at the end and <tt>T</tt> 
is <tt>CopyInsertable</tt> or <tt>is_nothrow_move_constructible&lt;T&gt;::value</tt>
is true, there are no effects. Otherwise, if an exception is thrown by the move constructor of a
non-<tt>CopyInsertable</tt> <tt>T</tt>, the effects are unspecified.
</span>
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
The wording leads to the following problem:
Copy and move assignment are invoked directly from <tt>vector</tt>.
For intermediary objects (see <a href="2164">2164</a>),
<tt>vector</tt> also directly invokes the copy and move constructor of the value type.
However, construction of the actual element within the buffer is invoked via the allocator abstraction.
As discussed above, the allocator currently is not required to call a copy/move constructor.
If <tt>is_nothrow_move_constructible&lt;T&gt;::value</tt> is <tt>true</tt> for some value type <tt>T</tt>,
but the allocator uses modifying operations for <tt>MoveInsertion</tt> that do throw,
the implementation is required to ensure that "there are no effects",
even if the source buffer has been modified.
<p/>
Similarly, the <tt>vector</tt> capacity functions specify exception safety guarantees
referring to the move constructor of the value type. For example, <tt>vector::resize</tt> in 22.3.11.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/vector.capacity">[vector.capacity]</a> p14:
</p>
<blockquote>
<i>Remarks</i>: If an exception is thrown other than by the move constructor of a
non-<tt>CopyInsertable</tt> <tt>T</tt> there are no effects.
</blockquote>
<p>
The wording leads to the same issue as described above.
<p/>
Code example:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class T&gt;
class allocator;

class pot_reg_type // a type which creates

  {
    new((void*)p) T(std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...);
  }
}; 
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <tt>construct</tt> member function template is only required for rebinding,
which can be required e.g. to store additional debug information in
the allocated memory (e.g. VS2013).
<p/>
Even though the value type has an accessible and <tt>noexcept(true)</tt> move
constructor, this allocator won't call that constructor for rvalue arguments.
In any case, it does not call a constructor for which vector has formulated its 
requirements. An exception thrown by a constructor called by this allocator is not
covered by the specification in 22.3.11.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/vector.modifiers">[vector.modifiers]</a> and therefore is
guaranteed not to have any effect on the vector object when resizing.
<p/>
For an example how this might invalidate the exception safety
guarantees, see <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/d/topic/std-discussion/BcM7ya8JeqY/discussion">this post on the std-discussion mailing list</a>.
<p/>
Another problem arises for value types whose constructors are private,
but may be called by the allocator e.g. via friendship.
Those value types are not <tt>MoveConstructible</tt> 
(<tt>is_move_constructible</tt> is false), yet they can be <tt>MoveInsertable</tt>.
It is not possible for <tt>vector</tt> to create intermediary objects (see <a href="2164">2164</a>) of such a type
by directly using the move constructor.
Current implementations of the single-element forms of <tt>vector::insert</tt> and <tt>vector::emplace</tt>
do create intermediary objects by directly calling one of the value type's constructors,
probably to allow inserting objects from references that alias other elements of the container.
As far as I can see, Table 100 &mdash; "Sequence container requirements" in 22.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/sequence.reqmts">[sequence.reqmts]</a>
does not require that the creation of such intermediare objects can be performed
by containers using the value type's constructor directly.
It is unclear to me if the allocator's construct function could be used to create those
intermediary objects, given that they have not been allocated by the allocator.
<p/>
Two possible solutions:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Add the following requirement to the <tt>allocator_traits::construct</tt> function:
If the parameter pack <tt>args</tt> consists of a single parameter of the type
<tt>value_type&amp;&amp;</tt>,
the function may only propagate exceptions if <tt>is_nothrow_move_constructible&lt;value_type&gt;::value</tt>
is <tt>false</tt>.
<p/>
Requiring <tt>alloctor_traits::construct</tt> to call a true copy/move constructor
of the value type breaks <tt>std::scoped_allocator_adapter</tt>,
as pointed out by <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/d/msg/std-discussion/0yxikZInp-E/Lxj-msFT22cJ">Casey Carter in a post on the std-discussion mailing list</a>.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
Change vector's criterion whether to move or copy when resizing:
<p/>
Instead of testing the value type's constructors via
<tt>is_move_constructible</tt>, check the value of
<tt>noexcept( allocator_traits&lt;Allocator&gt;::construct(alloc, ptr, rval) )</tt>
where
<tt>alloc</tt> is an lvalue of type <tt>Allocator</tt>,
<tt>ptr</tt> is an expression of type <tt>allocator_traits&lt;Allocator&gt;::pointer</tt>
and
<tt>rval</tt> is a non-const rvalue of type <tt>value_type</tt>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
A short discussion of the two solutions:
<p/>
Solution 1 allows keeping <tt>is_nothrow_move_constructible&lt;value_type&gt;</tt>
as the criterion for <tt>vector</tt> to decide between copying and moving when resizing.
It restricts what can be done inside the <tt>construct</tt> member function of allocators,
and requires implementers of allocators to pay attention to the value types used.
One could conceive allocators checking the following with a <tt>static_assert</tt>:
If the value type <tt>is_nothrow_move_constructible</tt>,
then the constructor actually called for <tt>MoveInsertion</tt> within the <tt>construct</tt>
member function is also declared as noexcept.
<p/>
Solution 2 requires changing both the implementation of the default
allocator (add a conditional <tt>noexcept</tt>) and <tt>vector</tt> (replace
<tt>is_move_constructible</tt> with an allocator-targeted check).
It does not impose additional restrictions on the allocator (other than
22.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a> p15),
and works nicely even if the move constructor of a <tt>MoveInsertable</tt> type is private or deleted
(the allocator might be a friend of the value type).
<p/>
In both cases, an addition might be required to provide the basic exception safety guarantee.

Essentially, if <tt>allocator_traits&lt;Allocator&gt;::construct</tt> throws an exception,
the object may or may not have been constructed.
Two solutions are mentioned in that discussion:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
<tt>allocator_traits&lt;Allocator&gt;::construct</tt> needs to tell its caller
whether or not the construction was successful, in case of an exception.
</p></li>
<li><p>
If <tt>allocator_traits&lt;Allocator&gt;::construct</tt> propagates an exception,
it shall either not have constructed an object at the specified location,
or that object shall have been destroyed
(or it shall ensure otherwise that no resources are leaked).
</p></li>
</ol>

<p><i>[2015-05-23, Tomasz Kami&nacute;ski comments]</i></p>

<p>
Solution 1 discussed in this issue also breaks support for the <tt>polymorphic_allocator</tt> proposed in the part 
of the Library Fundamentals TS v1, in addition to already mentioned <tt>std::scoped_allocator_adapter</tt>. Furthermore 
there is unknown impact on the other user-defined state-full allocators code written in the C++11.
<p/>
In addition the library resolution proposed in the LWG issues <a href="2089">2089</a> and 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4462.html">N4462</a>, 
will break the relation between the <tt>std::allocator_trait::construct</tt> method and 
copy/move constructor even for the standard <tt>std::allocator</tt>. As example please consider following class:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct NonCopyable
{
  NonCopyable() = default;
  NonCopyable(NonCopyable const&amp;) = delete;
  NonCopyable(NonCopyable&amp;&amp;) = delete;
};

struct InitListConstructor : NonCopyable
{
  InitListConstructor() = default;
  InitListConstructor(std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt;);
  operator int() const;
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
For the above declarations following expression are ill-formed:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
InitListConstructor copy(std::declval&lt;InitListConstructor const&amp;&gt;());
InitListConstructor move(std::declval&lt;InitListConstructor&amp;&amp;&gt;());
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
So the class is not <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> nor <tt>MoveConstructible</tt>. However the following are well formed:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
InitListConstructor copy{std::declval&lt;InitListConstructor const&amp;&gt;()};
InitListConstructor move{std::declval&lt;InitListConstructor&amp;&amp;&gt;()};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
And will be used by <tt>std::allocator&lt;InitListConstructor&gt;::construct</tt> in case of move-insertion 
and copy-insertion, after appliance of the resolution proposed in mentioned papers:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The gist of the proposed library fix is simple:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if <tt>is_constructible_v&lt;TargetType, Args...&gt;</tt>, use direct-nonlist-initialization</p></li>
<li><p>otherwise, use brace-initialization.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
As consequence the requirement proposed in the Solution 1:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If the parameter pack <tt>args</tt> consists of a single parameter of the type <tt>value_type&amp;&amp;</tt>, 
the function may only propagate exceptions if <tt>is_nothrow_move_constructible&lt;value_type&gt;::value</tt> is false. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Will no longer hold for the <tt>std::allocator</tt>.

<p>
It's unspecified how many times <tt>copy_n</tt> increments the <tt>InputIterator</tt>.
<tt>uninitialized_copy_n</tt> is specified to increment it exactly <tt>n</tt> times,
which means if an <tt>istream_iterator</tt> is used then the next character
after those copied is read from the stream and then discarded, losing data.
<p/>
I believe all three of Dinkumware, libc++ and libstdc++ implement
<tt>copy_n</tt> with <tt>n - 1</tt> increments of the <tt>InputIterator</tt>, which avoids reading
and discarding a character when used with <tt>istream_iterator</tt>, but is
inconsistent with <tt>uninitialized_copy_n</tt> and causes surprising behaviour
with <tt>istreambuf_iterator</tt> instead, because <tt>copy_n(in, 2, copy_n(in, 2,
out))</tt> is not equivalent to <tt>copy_n(in, 4, out)</tt>

<p>This is a mess. Append to Effects: If the InputIterator is not a forward iterator, increments n-1 times. Otherwise the number of increments is not more than n. (ncm) The preceding proposition is unsatisfactory, because it is wrong for istreambuf_iterator, which is much more useful than istream_iterator. Proposing instead: Append to Effects: If InputIterator is istream_iterator for some T, increments n-1 times. Otherwise, increments n times. Want a paper exploring what the implementations actually do, and what non-uniformity is "right".</p>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The standard library specifies a lot of heterogeneous comparison operators. For instance:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class... TTypes, class... UTypes&gt;
constexpr bool operator!=(const tuple&lt;TTypes...&gt;&amp;, const tuple&lt;UTypes...&gt;&amp;);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This has an unfortunate consequence:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
#include &lt;tuple&gt;
#include &lt;utility&gt;

using namespace std::rel_ops;
std::tuple&lt;int&gt; a(0);
bool b = a != a;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The last line here is ill-formed due to ambiguity: it might be <tt>rel_ops::operator!=</tt>, and it might be the 
heterogeneous tuple <tt>operator!=</tt>. These are not partially ordered, because they have different constraints: 
<tt>rel_ops</tt> requires the types to match, whereas the tuple comparison requires both types to be tuples (but not 
to match). The same thing happens for user code that defines its own unconstrained 
'<tt>template&lt;typename T&gt; operator!=(const T&amp;, const T&amp;)</tt>' rather than using <tt>rel_ops</tt>.
<p/>
One straightforward fix would be to add a homogeneous overload for each heterogeneous comparison:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class... TTypes&gt;
constexpr bool operator!=(const tuple&lt;TTypes...&gt;&amp;, const tuple&lt;TTypes...&gt;&amp;);
</pre>
<p>
This is then unambiguously chosen over the other options in the preceding case. FWIW, libstdc++ already does this 
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.6.4/libstdc++/api/a01065_source.html#l00788">in some cases</a>.

<p/>
Is the same conversion state object used for converting both the get

through a multibyte character will leave some shift state in cvtstate, 
which would then be used by a following write, even though the shift 
state of the get area is unrelated to the put area.

<p>
Paragraph 4 of D.15.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/depr.conversions.string">[depr.conversions.string]</a> introduces <tt>byte_err_string</tt> 
as "a byte string to display on errors". What does display mean? The string is returned 
on error, it's not displayed anywhere.
<p/>
Paragraph 14 says "Otherwise, if the object was constructed with a
byte-error string, the member function shall return the byte-error
string." The term byte-error string is not used anywhere else.
<p/>
Paragraph 17 talks about storing "default values in <tt>byte_err_string</tt>".
What default value? Is "Hello, world!" allowed? If it means
default-construction it should say so. If paragraph 14 says it won't
be used what does it matter how it's initialized? The end of the
paragraph refers to storing "<tt>byte_err</tt> in <tt>byte_err_string</tt>". This should
be more clearly related to the wording in paragraph 14.
<p/>
It might help if the constructor (and destructor) was specified before
the other member functions, so it can more formally define the
difference between being "constructed with a byte-error string" and
not.
<p/>
All the same issues apply to the <tt>wide_err_string</tt> member.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
It is not entirely clear if and when the specializations of <tt>std::less</tt> (and friends) for pointer types 
can be used in a constant expression. Consider the following code:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;functional&gt;

struct foo {};
foo x, y;
constexpr bool b = std::less&lt;foo*&gt;{}(&amp;x, &amp;y); // [1]

foo z[] = {{}, {}};
constexpr bool ba = std::less&lt;foo*&gt;{}(&amp;z[0], &amp;z[1]); // [2]
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Comparing the address of unrelated objects is not a constant expression since the result is unspecified, so 
it could be expected for [1] to fail and [2] to succeed. However, <tt>std::less</tt> specialization for pointer 
types is well-defined and yields a total order, so it could just as well be expected for [1] to succeed. Finally, 
since the implementation of such specializations is not mandated, [2] could fail as well (This could happen, if
an implementation would provide such a specialization and if that would use built-in functions that would not be
allowed in constant expressions, for example). In any case, the standard should be clear so as to avoid 
implementation-defined <tt>constexpr</tt>-ness.
</p>

<p><i>[2017-01-22, Jens provides rationale and proposed wording]</i></p>

<p>
<tt>std::less&lt;T*&gt;</tt> is required to deliver a total order on pointers.
However, the layout of global objects is typically determined
by the linker, not the compiler, so requiring <tt>std::less&lt;T*&gt;</tt> to
provide an ordering at compile-time that is consistent with
run-time would need results from linking to feed back to
the compiler, something that C++ has traditionally not required.

<p>
I do not believe that the wording in 20.15.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/meta.unary.prop">[meta.unary.prop]</a> paragraph 3 allows for the following program to be ill-formed:
</p>

std::is_assignable&lt;A&lt;int&gt;, int&gt; q;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In particular, I do not see where the wording allows for the "compilation of the expression" 
<tt>declval&lt;T&gt;() = declval&lt;U&gt;()</tt> to occur as a consequence of instantiating <tt>std::is_assignable&lt;T, U&gt;</tt> 
(where <tt>T</tt> and <tt>U</tt> are, respectively, <tt>A&lt;int&gt;</tt> and <tt>int</tt> in the example code).
<p/>
Instantiating <tt>A&lt;int&gt;</tt> as a result of requiring it to be a complete type does not trigger the instantiation of 
<tt>B&lt;int&gt;</tt>; however, the "compilation of the expression" in question does.

In the current 29.7.5.1.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/ostream.sentry">[ostream.sentry]</a>, p4 refers to the now deprecated <tt>std::uncaught_exception()</tt>: 
D.9 [depr.uncaught].

<p>
This needs to be changed, for example to use <tt>std::uncaught_exceptions()</tt> and to capture the value on entry and 
compare with the saved value on exit.

29.6.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/streambuf">[streambuf]</a> p1 says:

The class template <tt>basic_streambuf&lt;charT, traits&gt;</tt> serves as an abstract base class for deriving various

</p></blockquote>
<p>
The term "abstract base class" is not defined in the standard, but "abstract class" is (11.6.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/class.abstract">[class.abstract]</a>).
<p/>
According to the synopsis <tt>basic_streambuf</tt> has no pure virtual
functions so is not an abstract class and none of libstdc++, libc++, or
dinkumware implement it as an abstract class. I don't believe the wording was
ever intended to require it to be an abstract class, but it could be
read that way.
<p/>
I suggest the wording be changed to "polymorphic base class" or
something else that can't be seen to imply a normative requirement to
make it an abstract class.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The concurrency libraries specified in clauses 29 and 30 do not adequately specify how they relate to the concurrency model 
specified in 6.8.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.multithread">[intro.multithread]</a>. In particular:
<p/>
6.8.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.multithread">[intro.multithread]</a> specifies "atomic objects" as having certain properties. I can only assume that instances 
of the classes defined in Clause 29 are intended to be "atomic objects" in this sense, but I can't find any wording to 
specify that, and it's genuinely unclear whether Clause 30 objects are atomic objects. In fact, on a literal reading the 
C++ Standard doesn't appear to provide <em>any</em> portable way to create an atomic object, or even determine whether an 
object is an atomic object.
<p/>
(It's not clear if the term "atomic object" is actually needed, given that atomic objects can have non-atomic operations, 
and non-atomic objects can have atomic operations. But even if the term itself goes away, there still needs to be some 
indication that Clause 29 objects have the properties currently attributed to atomic objects).
<p/>
Similarly, 6.8.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.multithread">[intro.multithread]</a> uses "atomic operation" as a term of art, but the standard never unambiguously 
identifies any operation as an "atomic operation" (although in one case it unambiguously identifies an operation that is 
<em>not</em> atomic). It does come close in a few cases, but not close enough:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>6.8.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.multithread">[intro.multithread]</a>/p7 could be read to imply that "synchronization operations" in Clauses 29 and 30 
are also atomic operations. However, that's vague and indirect, and somewhat belied by 32.4.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.mutex.requirements.mutex">[thread.mutex.requirements.mutex]</a>/p5, 
which specifies that mutex lock and unlock operations "behave as atomic operations", but only "for purposes of determining 
the existence of a data race". Furthermore, not a single operation in Clause 29 explicitly identifies itself as a 
"synchronization operation".</p></li>
<li><p>31.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.types.generic">[atomics.types.generic]</a>/p4 states in part that "There shall be a specialization <tt>atomic&lt;bool&gt;</tt> 
which provides the general atomic operations as specified in 29.6.1", but read in context, "general atomic operations" 
appears to be a loose synonym for "general operations on atomic types" as defined in  [atomics.types.operations.general], 
rather than a use of "atomic object" as Words of Power. Incidentally, "atomic type" is never satisfactorily defined either 
(although the <tt>&lt;atomic&gt;</tt> synopsis comes close).</p></li>
<li><p>17.13 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/support.runtime">[support.runtime]</a>/p10 specifies exactly which operations are "plain lock-free atomic operations", but 
in a standard where an "integral constant expression" isn't necessarily a "constant expression", I do not feel safe assuming 
that a "plain lock-free atomic operation" is an "atomic operation".</p></li>
<li><p>Hans Boehm tells me the operations with "atomically" in the Effects element are intended to be atomic operations, 
but since "atomic operation" is a term of art (e.g. in 6.8.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.multithread">[intro.multithread]</a>/p27.4), I think this needs to be 
spelled out rather than assumed. Furthermore, this does not help with 31.10 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.fences">[atomics.fences]</a>, or anything in Clause 30.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><i>[2018-03 JAX; Geoffrey comments in behalf of SG1]</i></p>

<p>
SG1 consensus is that operations outside clause 32 are not "atomic operations", and objects of types defined outside clause 32 are not "atomic objects". "Synchronization operations" are operations which act as endpoints of primitive edges of partial orders other than sequenced-before, but it may make more sense to just drop that term and inline the definition, so to speak.
<p/>
We would welcome a paper to make those definitions more explicit, and revise the wording as needed to be consistent with those definitions.

<p>
The enumeration type <tt>codecvt_mode</tt> is effectively a bitmask type
(16.4.2.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/bitmask.types">[bitmask.types]</a>) with three elements, but isn't defined as
such.
<p/>
This harms usability because bitmask types are required to work well
with bitwise operators, but <tt>codecvt_mode</tt> doesn't have overloaded
operators, making it very inconvenient to combine values:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::codecvt_utf16&lt;char32_t, 0x10FFFF,
  static_cast&lt;std::codecvt_mode&gt;(std::little_endian|std::generate_header)&gt;
cvt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The <tt>static_cast</tt> harms readability and should not be necessary.
<p/>
I suggest that either <tt>codecvt_mode</tt> is specified to be a bitmask type,
or as a minimal fix we provide an overloaded <tt>operator|</tt> that returns
the right type.

17.6.2.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/new.delete.dataraces">[new.delete.dataraces]</a> uses obsolete wording.
<p/>
It should introduce a "synchronizes with" relationship. "Happens before" is too weak, since that may not composes 
with sequenced before.
<p/>
The "shall not introduce a data race" wording is probably not technically correct either. These may race with other 
(non-allocation/deallocation) concurrent accesses to the object being allocated or deallocated.

<p>
I recently encountered a failure related to questionable use of <tt>do_get_year</tt>. The platform where the code happened 
to work had an implementation which handled certain three-digit "year identifiers" as the number of years since 
1900 (<a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/remembering-y2k/228701726">this article</a> describes such an implementation).
<p/>
28.4.5.1.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/locale.time.get.virtuals">[locale.time.get.virtuals]</a> makes it implementation defined whether two-digit years are accepted, etc., but does not 
say anything specifically about three-digit years.
<p/>
The implementation freedom to not report errors in 28.4.5.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/locale.time.get">[locale.time.get]</a> paragraph 1 also seems to be too broad.

<p>
The allocator-aware container requirements in Table 98 impose no
<tt>MoveAssignable</tt> requirements on the <tt>value_type</tt> when
<tt>propagate_on_container_move_assignment</tt> is true, because typically the
container's storage would be moved by just exchanging some pointers.
<p/>
However for a <tt>basic_string</tt> using the small string optimization move
assignment may need to assign individual characters into the small
string buffer, even when the allocator propagates.
<p/>
The only requirement on the char-like objects stored in a <tt>basic_string</tt>
are that they are non-array POD types and <tt>Destructible</tt>, which means
that a POD type with a deleted move assignment operator should be
usable in a <tt>basic_string</tt>, despite it being impossible to move assign:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;string&gt;

struct odd_pod 
{
  odd_pod() = default;
  odd_pod&amp; operator=(odd_pod&amp;&amp;) = delete;
};

static_assert(std::is_pod&lt;odd_pod&gt;::value, "POD");

int main()
{
  using S = std::basic_string&lt;odd_pod&gt;;
  S s;
  s = S{};       // fails
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Using libstdc++ <tt>basic_string&lt;odd_pod&gt;</tt> cannot even be
default-constructed because the constructor attempts to assign the
null terminator to the first element of the small string buffer.
<p/>
Similar problems exist with POD types with a deleted default constructor.
<p/>
I believe that <tt>basic_string</tt> should require its <tt>value_type</tt> to be at
least <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt> and <tt>MoveAssignable</tt>.

<li><p>take only 24 random bits and convert them to a <tt>float x</tt> in the range <tt>[0, 1)</tt> and then return <tt>-log(1 - x)</tt>.</p></li>

<p>
I have not checked if <tt>std::exponential_distribution&lt;double&gt;</tt> has the same problem:
For <tt>float</tt> on the average 1 out of 2<sup>24</sup> (~10<sup>7</sup>) draws returns "inf", which is easily confirmed.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The <tt>std::tuple</tt> order of element construction is unspecified. It is either in the same order of the type list or in reverse. 
<p/>
Consider the following program:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;tuple&gt;

struct X 
{
  X(int) { std::cout &lt;&lt; "X constructor\n"; }
};

struct Y 
{
  Y(int) { std::cout &lt;&lt; "Y constructor\n"; }
};

int main()
{
  std::tuple&lt;X, Y&gt; t(1, 2);
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Here is a <a href="http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/764d0477523ba249">link</a> to two sample compilations. The first uses 
libstdc++ and constructs in reverse order, and the second uses libc++ and constructs in in-order. 
<p/>
A <tt>std::tuple</tt> mimics both a struct and type-generic container and should thus follow their standards. Construction is 
fundamentally different from a function call, and it has been historically important for a specific order to be guaranteed; 
namely: whichever the developer may decide. Mandating construction order will allow developers to reference younger elements 
later on in the chain as well, much like a struct allows you to do with its members.
<p/>
There are implementation issues as well. Reversed lists will require unnecessary overhead for braced-initializer-list initialization.  
Since lists are evaluated from left to right, the initializers must be placed onto the stack to respect the construction order. 
This issue could be significant for large tuples, deeply nested tuples, or tuples with elements that require 
many constructor arguments.
<p/>
I propose that the <tt>std::tuple&lt;A, B, ..., Y, Z&gt;</tt>'s constructor implementation be standardized, and made to construct 
in the same order as its type list e.g. <tt>A{}, B{}, ..., Y{}, Z{}</tt>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Daniel:</b>
<p/>
When <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3140.html">N3140</a> became accepted, wording had been
added that gives at least an indication of requiring element initialization in the order of the declaration of the template
parameters. This argumentation can be based on 20.5.3.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/tuple.cnstr">[tuple.cnstr]</a> p3 (emphasize mine):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
-3- In the constructor descriptions that follow, let <tt><i>i</i></tt> be in the range <tt>[0,sizeof...(Types))</tt> 
<span style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bold">in order</span>, 
<tt><i>Ti</i></tt> be the <tt><i>i<sup>th</sup></i></tt> type in <tt>Types</tt>, and <tt><i>Ui</i></tt> be the 
<tt><i>i<sup>th</sup></i></tt> type in a template parameter pack named <tt>UTypes</tt>, where indexing is
zero-based.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But the current wording needs to be improved to make that intention clearer and an issue like this one is necessary to be sure that
the committee is agreeing (or disagreeing) with that intention, especially because N3140 didn't really point out the relevance of the element
construction order in the discussion, and because not all constructors explicitly refer to the ordered sequence of numbers generated
by the variable <tt><i>i</i></tt> (The move constructor does it right, but most other don't do that). 
</p>

<p><i>[2017-02-12, Alisdair comments]</i></p>

<p>
Note that this issue should not be extended to cover the assignment operators,
as implementations may want the freedom to re-order member-wise assignment
so that, for example, all potentially-throwing assignments are performed before
non-throwing assignments (as indicated by the <tt>noexcept</tt> operator).

<p>
When a shared-state is released, it may be necessary to execute user defined code for the destructor of a 
stored value or exception. It is unclear whether the execution of said destructor constitutes an observable side effect.
</p>
<p>
While discussing N4445 in Lenexa, Nat Goodspeed pointed out that 32.6.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/futures.state">[futures.state]</a>/5.1 does not explicitly 
mention the destruction of the result, so implementations should be allowed to release (or reuse) a shared state ahead 
of time under the "as-if" rule.
<p/>
The standard should clarify whether the execution of destructors is a visible side effect of releasing a shared state.

<tt>promise::set_value_at_thread_exit</tt> and <tt>promise::set_exception_at_thread_exit</tt> operate on a shared state 
at thread exit, without making the thread participate in the ownership of such shared state.
<p/>
Consider the following snippet:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::promise&lt;int&gt;{}.set_value_at_thread_exit(42);

<p>
Arguably, since the <tt>promise</tt> abandons its shared state without actually making it ready, a <tt>broken_promise</tt> 
error condition should be stored in the shared state. Implementations diverge, they either crash at thread exit by 
dereferencing an invalid pointer, or keep the shared state around until thread exit.

<p>
In <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4538.pdf">N4538</a>, the continuation given to 
<tt>future::then</tt> can be run "on an unspecified thread of execution". This is too broad, as it allows the 
continuation to be run on the main thread, a UI thread, or any other thread. In comparison, functions given to 
<tt>async</tt> run "as if in a new thread of execution", while the Parallelism TS gives less guarantees by running 
"in either the invoking thread or in a thread implicitly created by the library to support parallel algorithm execution". 
The threads on which the continuation given to <tt>future::then</tt> can run should be similarly constrained.
</p>

<p><i>[2017-03-01, Kona, SG1]</i></p>

<p>
Agreement that this is a problem. Suggested addition to the issue is below. We have no immediate delivery vehicle 
for a fix at the moment, but we would like to make the intended direction clear.
<p/>
There is SG1 consensus that <tt>.then</tt> continuations should, by default, and in the absence of executors, be run 
only in the following ways:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If the future is not ready when <tt>.then()</tt> is called, the <tt>.then</tt> argument may be run on the execution 
agent that fulfills the promise.</p></li>
<li><p>In all cases, the <tt>.then</tt> argument may be run on an implementation-provided thread, i.e. a thread that is 
neither the main thread nor explicitly created by the user.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
In the absence of an executor argument (which currently cannot be supplied), running of the <tt>.then()</tt> continuation 
will not block the thread calling <tt>.then()</tt>, even if the future is ready at the time.
<p/>
Straw polls:
<p/>
SF | F | N | A | SA
<p/>
For the default behaviour:
<p/>
"1. Run on completed task or new execution agent"
<p/>
0 | 7 | 5 | 1 | 0
<p/>
"2. Run on completed task or <tt>.then</tt> caller"
<p/>
0 | 0 | 5 | 5 | 3
<p/>
"3. Leave as implementation defined"
<p/>
1 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 3
<p/>
"4. Always new execution agent"
<p/>
2 | 3 | 6 | 2 | 0
<p/>
The actual conclusion was to allow either (1) or (4) for now, since they are quite close, but present a very different 
programming mode from (2).

In 30.13 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.grammar">[re.grammar]</a> paragraph 2:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<tt>basic_regex</tt> member functions shall not call any locale dependent C or C++ API, including the formatted 
string input functions. Instead they shall call the appropriate traits member function to achieve the required effect.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Yet, the required interface for a regular expression traits class (30.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/re.req">[re.req]</a>) does not appear to have 
any reliable method for determining whether a character as encoded for the locale associated with the traits 
instance is the same as a character represented by a <em>UnicodeEscapeSequence</em>, e.g., assuming a sane 
<tt>ru_RU.koi8r</tt> locale:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;regex&gt;

const char data[] = "\xB3";
const char matchCyrillicCaptialLetterYo[] = R"(\u0401)";

int main(void) 
{
  try {
    std::regex myRegex;
    myRegex.imbue(std::locale("ru_RU.koi8r"));

    myRegex.assign(matchCyrillicCaptialLetterYo, std::regex_constants::ECMAScript);
    printf("(%s)\n", std::regex_replace(std::string(data), myRegex, std::string("E")).c_str());

    myRegex.assign("[[:alpha:]]", std::regex_constants::ECMAScript);
    printf("(%s)\n", std::regex_replace(std::string(data), myRegex, std::string("E")).c_str());
  } catch (std::regex_error&amp; e) {
    abort();
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The implementation I tried prints:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
(&#x401;)
(E)

<p>
Which means that the character class matching worked, but not the matching to the <em>UnicodeEscapeSequence</em>.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
A number of places in the library, including 20.14.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/comparisons">[comparisons]</a>/14, the Optional container requirements in 
22.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.requirements.general">[container.requirements.general]</a>, and 32.3.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/thread.thread.id">[thread.thread.id]</a>/8, use the phrase "total order". 
Unfortunately, that phrase is ambiguous. In mathematics, the most common definition is that a relation <tt>&le;</tt> is 
a total order if it's total, transitive, and antisymmetric in the sense that <tt>x&le;y &#x2227; y&le;x &rArr; x=y</tt>. 
What we really want is a strict total order: a relation <tt>&lt;</tt> is a strict total order if it's total, transitive, and 
antisymmetric in the sense that exactly one of <tt>x&lt;y</tt>, <tt>y&lt;x</tt>, and <tt>x=y</tt> holds.
</p>
<p>
The non-normative note in 25.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/alg.sorting">[alg.sorting]</a>/4 correctly uses the phrase "strict total ordering" rather than 
simply "total ordering".
</p>
<p>
We could address this issue by replacing "total order" with "strict total order" everywhere it appears, since I 
think there are no cases where we actually want a non-strict total order, or we could add something in Clause 17 saying 
that we always mean strict total order whenever we say total order.

As pointed out in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4511.html#Related_Issues">N4511</a>,
the Library fundamentals are affected by a similar problem as described in LWG <a href="2456">2456</a>. First, it is caused
by <tt>optional</tt>'s member <tt>swap</tt> (5.3.4 [fund.ts.v2::optional.object.swap]):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void swap(optional&lt;T&gt;&amp; rhs) noexcept(<i>see below</i>);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
with 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The expression inside <tt>noexcept</tt> is equivalent to: 
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
is_nothrow_move_constructible_v&lt;T&gt; &amp;&amp; noexcept(swap(declval&lt;T&amp;&gt;(), declval&lt;T&amp;&gt;()))
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, the unqualified lookup for <tt>swap</tt> finds the member <tt>swap</tt> instead of the result of a normal argument-depending 
lookup, making this ill-formed.
<p/>
A second example of such a problem recently entered the arena with the addition of the <tt>propagate_const</tt> template
with another member <tt>swap</tt> (3.7.8 [fund.ts.v2::propagate_const.modifiers]):
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
constexpr void swap(propagate_const&amp; pt) noexcept(<i>see below</i>);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-2- The constant-expression in the exception-specification is <tt>noexcept(swap(t_, pt.t_))</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
A working approach is presented in 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4511.html#Proposed_resolution">N4511</a>. By adding a new
trait to the standard library and referencing this by the library fundamentals (A similar approach had been applied in the
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3940.html#path-inserter-extractor">file system specification</a>
where the <tt>quoted</tt> manipulator from C++14 had been referred to, albeit the file system specification is generally based on the
C++11 standard), <tt>optional</tt>'s member <tt>swap</tt> exception specification could be rephrased as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The expression inside <tt>noexcept</tt> is equivalent to: 
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
is_nothrow_move_constructible_v&lt;T&gt; &amp;&amp; <ins>is_nothrow_swappable_v&lt;T&gt;</ins><del>noexcept(swap(declval&lt;T&amp;&gt;(), declval&lt;T&amp;&gt;()))</del>
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
and <tt>propagate_const</tt>'s member <tt>swap</tt> exception specification could be rephrased as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
constexpr void swap(propagate_const&amp; pt) noexcept(<i>see below</i>);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-2- The constant-expression in the exception-specification is <tt><ins>is_nothrow_swappable_v&lt;T&gt;</ins><del>noexcept(swap(t_, pt.t_))</del></tt>.

[This is essentially LWG <a href="2370">2370</a>, but deals with the fundamentals TS version rather than the one in the standard]
<p/>
In 4.2 [fund.ts.v2::func.wrap.func] of library fundamentals TS, the constructors
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class A&gt; function(allocator_arg_t, const A&amp;) noexcept;
template&lt;class A&gt; function(allocator_arg_t, const A&amp;, nullptr_t) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
must type-erase and store the provided allocator, since the <tt>operator=</tt> specification requires using the "allocator 
specified in the construction of" the <tt>std::experimental::function</tt> object. This may require a dynamic allocation 
and so cannot be noexcept. Similarly, the following constructors
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class A&gt; function(allocator_arg_t, const A&amp;, const function&amp;); 
template&lt;class A&gt; function(allocator_arg_t, const A&amp;, function&amp;&amp;);
template&lt;class F, class A&gt; function(allocator_arg_t, const A&amp;, F);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
cannot satisfy the C++14 requirement that they "shall not throw exceptions if [the <tt>function</tt> object to be stored] 
is a callable object passed via <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> or a function pointer" if they need to type-erase and store the 
allocator.

<p>
Currently 27.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.syn">[time.syn]</a> states
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<i>// convenience typedefs</i>
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 64 bits</i>,        nano&gt; nanoseconds;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 55 bits</i>,       micro&gt; microseconds;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 45 bits</i>,       milli&gt; milliseconds;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 35 bits</i>             &gt; seconds;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 29 bits</i>, ratio&lt;  60&gt;&gt; minutes;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 23 bits</i>, ratio&lt;3600&gt;&gt; hours;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
However, a <tt>duration_cast&lt;minutes&gt;(seconds::max())</tt> would cause overflow if the underlying signed integers 
only met the minimums specified.
<p/>
The standard should specify that implementations guarantee that a <tt>duration_cast</tt> from any smaller duration in 
these "convenience typedefs" will not overflow any larger duration. That is, <tt>hours</tt> should be able to hold 
the maximum of <tt>minutes</tt>, which should be able to hold the maximum of <tt>seconds</tt> and so on.
<p/>
More formally, if the ratio <tt>typedef A</tt> and <tt>typedef B</tt> is <tt>1:Y</tt> where <tt>Y &gt; 1</tt> (e.g., 
1 : 60 in case of <tt>minutes</tt> : <tt>seconds</tt>), then <tt>#bits<sub>A</sub>-1</tt> must be at least 
<tt>ceil(log<sub>2</sub>(2<sup>#bits<sub>B</sub>-1)/Y)</sup>)</tt>.
<p/>
In the case of <tt>minutes</tt> : <tt>seconds</tt>, <tt>X = 1</tt>, <tt>Y = 60</tt>. Let 
<tt>#bits<sub>seconds</sub> = 32</tt>. Therefore:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><tt>2<sup>(#bits<sub>seconds</sub> - 1)</sup> = 2<sup>31</sup> = 2147483648</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>ceil(log<sub>2</sub>(2<sup>31</sup> / 60) = 26</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>#bits<sub>minutes</sub> - 1 = 26</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>#bits<sub>minutes</sub> = 27</tt></p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Therefore, a minimum of 27 bits would be needed to store <tt>minutes</tt> if 32 were used to store <tt>seconds</tt>.
<p/>
I propose to change the definitions of the convenience typedefs as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<i>// convenience typedefs</i>
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 64 bits</i>,        nano&gt; nanoseconds;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 55 bits</i>,       micro&gt; microseconds;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 46 bits</i>,       milli&gt; milliseconds;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 37 bits</i>             &gt; seconds;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 32 bits</i>, ratio&lt;  60&gt;&gt; minutes;
typedef duration&lt;<i>signed integer type of at least 27 bits</i>, ratio&lt;3600&gt;&gt; hours;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
These bits were chosen to satisfy the above formula. Note that
minimums only increased, so larger ranges could be held. A nice
outcome of this choice is that <tt>minutes</tt> does not go above 32 bits.
</p>

<p><i>[2016-04-23, Tim Song comments]</i></p>

<p>
The P/R of LWG 2592 doesn't fix the issue it wants to solve, because the actual underlying type will likely 
have more bits than the specified minimum.
<p/>
Consider <tt>seconds</tt>, which the P/R requires to have at least 37 bits. On a typical system this implies 
using a 64-bit integer. To ensure that casting from <tt>seconds::max()</tt> to <tt>minutes</tt> doesn't overflow 
in such a system, it is necessary for the latter to have at least 59 bits (which means, in practice, 64 bits too), 
not just 32 bits. Thus, just changing the minimum number of bits will not be able to provide the desired guarantee 
that casting from a smaller unit to a larger one never overflow.
<p/>
If such a guarantee is to be provided, it needs to be spelled out directly. Note that the difference here is 9 bits 
(for the 1000-fold case) and 5 bits (for the 60-fold case), which is less than the size difference between integer 
types on common systems, so such a requirement would effectively require those convenience typedefs to use the 
same underlying integer type.

<h3><a name="2594" href="2594">2594.</a> Contradicting definition of empty <tt>shared_ptr</tt> on <tt>shared_ptr(nullptr, d)</tt></h3>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Latest draft (N4567) 20.11.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared">[util.smartptr.shared]</a> p1 says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A <tt>shared_ptr</tt> object is <em>empty</em> if it does not own a pointer.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Please note that it says "own a pointer". This definition was added as
the resolution for LWG defect <a href="813">813</a>.
<p/>
20.11.3.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared.const">[util.smartptr.shared.const]</a> p8 says about the effect of
<tt>shared_ptr(nullptr_t p, D d)</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects</i>: Constructs a <tt>shared_ptr</tt> object that <em>owns</em> the object <tt>p</tt> and the deleter <tt>d</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Please note that it says "<em>owns</em> the object". This was intentionally
changed from "the pointer" as a part of resolution for LWG defect <a href="758">758</a>,
to cover <tt>nullptr_t</tt> case.
<p/>
Since <tt>shared_ptr(nullptr, d)</tt> owns an object of type <tt>nullptr_t</tt>, but does
not own a pointer, it is said as "empty" by a strict reading of the
above mentioned definition in 20.11.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared">[util.smartptr.shared]</a> p1.
<p/>
These cause a contradiction:
<p/>
20.11.3.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared.const">[util.smartptr.shared.const]</a> p9 sets a postcondition
<tt>use_count() == 1</tt> on <tt>shared_ptr(nullptr, d)</tt>. But 
20.11.3.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared.obs">[util.smartptr.shared.obs]</a> p7 says that the return value of <tt>use_count()</tt>
is "<tt>0</tt> when <tt>*this</tt> is <em>empty</em>".
</p>
<p>
Proposed wording changes:
<p/>
Replace the last 2 words in 20.11.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared">[util.smartptr.shared]</a> p1 from
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[&hellip;] <em>empty</em> if it does not own a pointer.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
to
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[&hellip;] <em>empty</em> if it does not own an object.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Note that <tt>shared_ptr(nullptr_t)</tt> is defined to be empty in synopsis in
20.11.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared">[util.smartptr.shared]</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
constexpr shared_ptr(nullptr_t) noexcept : shared_ptr() { }
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
It could be less confusing if <tt>shared_ptr(nullptr, d)</tt> could be defined to
be empty. But it seems too late to change that (which means changing
whether the deleter is called or not, see 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11164354/">this Stackoverflow article</a>). 
Then I'm proposing just fix the contradiction.

In <a href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2014/n4169.html">N4169</a>
the author dropped the <tt>invoke&lt;R&gt;</tt> support by claiming
that it's an unnecessary cruft in TR1, obsoleted by C++11
type inference.  But now we have some new business went
to *<tt><i>INVOKE</i></tt>*<tt>(f, t1, t2, ..., tN, R)</tt>, that is to discard the
return type when <tt>R</tt> is <tt>void</tt>. This form is very useful, or
possible even more useful than the basic form when
implementing a call wrapper. Also note that the optional
<tt>R</tt> support is already in <tt>std::is_callable</tt> and
<tt>std::is_nothrow_callable</tt>.

<p><i>[2016-07-31, Tomasz Kami&nacute;ski comments]</i></p>

<p>
The lack of <tt>invoke&lt;R&gt;</tt> was basically a result of the concurrent publication of the never revision 
of the paper and additional special semantics of <tt><i>INVOKE</i>(f, args..., void)</tt>.
<p/>
In contrast to existing <tt>std::invoke</tt> function, the proposed <tt>invoke&lt;R&gt;</tt> version is not 
SFINAE friendly, as elimination of the standard version of invoke is guaranteed by <tt>std::result_of_t</tt> 
in the result type that is missing for proposed <tt>invoke&lt;R&gt;</tt> version. To provide this guarantee, 
following remarks shall be added to the specification:

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Remarks:</i> This function shall not participate in overload resolution unless 
<tt>is_callable_v&lt;F(Args...), R&gt;</tt> is <tt>true</tt>.

<p>
The description of <tt>money_base::space</tt> is that "at least one space is required at that position." 
(N4582 subclause 22.4.6.3 [locale.moneypunct] paragraph 2)
<p/>
When formatting for output (28.4.6.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/locale.money.put.virtuals">[locale.money.put.virtuals]</a>), it is not clear that
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<li><p>
"the number of characters generated for the specified format" (excluding fill padding) includes exactly 
one character for <tt>money_base::space</tt> (if present), and
</p></li>
<li><p>
all characters corresponding to <tt>money_base::space</tt> (excluding fill padding) are copies of <tt>fill</tt>.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
In particular, there is implementation divergence over point (b) as to whether U+0020 or <tt>fill</tt> should be used.
Further, should a character other than <tt>fill</tt> be used, it is unclear when "the fill characters are 
placed where <tt>none</tt> or <tt>space</tt> appears in the formatting pattern", whether the fill characters are placed 
at the beginning or the end of the "space field".
<p/>
I believe that a strict interpretation of the current wording supports U+0020; however, <tt>fill</tt> is more likely 
to be the pragmatic choice.
</p>

at least one space is required at that position. For output, the value <tt>space</tt> indicates one instance of the

<p>
In N4582 subclause 17.6.5.5 [member.functions], the requirement that:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
any call to the member function that would select an overload from the set of declarations described in this 
standard behaves as if that overload were selected
</p></blockquote>
<p>
is unclear in the extent of the "as if". For example, in providing:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
basic_string(const charT* s);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
for a one-argument call to:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
basic_string(const charT* s, const Allocator&amp; a = Allocator());
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
it can be read that an implementation may be required to call the copy constructor for the allocator since 
the core language rules for copy elision would not allow the "a" argument to be constructed directly into 
the member used to store the allocator.
<p/>
Clarification (even if just a note) would be appreciated.

Please look through the following modifications on a value <tt>v</tt> of type <tt>vector&lt;T&gt;</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
assert(v.size() &gt; 0);
v.push_back(v[0]);
v.insert(v.begin(), v[0]);
v.resize(v.size() * 2, v[0]);
v.assign(v.size() * 2, v[0]);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
All of these use an element of itself which may be moved or destroyed by
the modification.
<p/>
From what I see so far, the first three are required to work. Please
see library issue <a href="526">526</a> for validity of them.
<p/>
But only the last one is undefined because it violates a precondition of
a sequence container operation. I think this is too subtle.
<p/>
Should it be like that, really?
<p/>
The precondition is in Table 107 "Sequence container requirements" at the next 
of 22.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/sequence.reqmts">[sequence.reqmts]</a> p3.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
I looked into the following implementations:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
libc++ relies on the precondition.
<p/>
It deallocates first on <tt>n &gt; capacity()</tt> case,
see <a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/libcxx/blob/release_38/include/vector#L1415">here</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
libstdc++ doesn't rely on the precondition.
<p/>
It creates temporary <tt>vector(n, t)</tt> and <tt>swap()</tt>
on <tt>n &gt; capacity()</tt> case, see
<a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/gcc_5_3_0_release/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits/vector.tcc#L223">here</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
MSVC relies on the precondition.
<p/>
It unconditionally does <tt>clear()</tt> and then <tt>insert(begin(), n, t)</tt>.
I looked into my local "%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%/Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0/VC/include/vector".
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
One drawback of libstdc++ implementation, I could find so far, is
possibly increased peek memory usage (both old and new buffer exist at
the same time). But, because the same can happen on the most other
modifications, it seems a reasonable trade-off to remove the
precondition to fill the subtle gap. Users who really needs less memory
usage can do <tt>clear()</tt> and <tt>insert()</tt> by themselves.
<p/>
I also found that <tt>basic_string::assign(n, c)</tt> is safe on this point.
At 21.3.2.6.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/string.assign">[string.assign]</a> p17:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
basic_string&amp; assign(size_type n, charT c);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects</i>: Equivalent to <tt>assign(basic_string(n, c))</tt>.
<p/>
<i>Returns</i>: <tt>*this</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
This can be seen as another gap.
<p/>
Looking back on the history, I found that the definition of <tt>assign(n, t)</tt>
was changed at C++14 for library issue <a href="2209">2209</a>. There were more restricting 
definitions like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
void assign(size_type n, const T&amp; t);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>

I think the precondition was probably set to accept this old definition

The current specification of <tt>recursion_pending()</tt> says (29.11.13.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/fs.rec.dir.itr.members">[fs.rec.dir.itr.members]</a>/24):

This language does not take into account cases where the prior construction was a copy construction from a iterator,

<p><i>[2018-05-23: Casey restores the intended design with an expansion of the original PR]</i></p>

<p>
The intended design is that all copies of a single <tt>recursive_directory_iterator</tt> share a
common block of state which includes the values returned by <tt>options</tt>, <tt>depth</tt>, and
<tt>recursion_pending</tt> - hence the mandate that those functions not be called on a
non-dereferenceable iterator in 29.11.13 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/fs.class.rec.dir.itr">[fs.class.rec.dir.itr]</a> para 2. To allow an
implementation with such shared state, it's necessary to make changes to the value returned by
<tt>recursion_pending()</tt> visible to <em>all copies</em> of the same dereferenceable iterator.
</p><p>
Also:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><tt>pop</tt> notionally calls <tt>increment</tt> repeatedly until the current directory is
exhausted, <tt>pop</tt> should affect the value of <tt>recursion_pending</tt> similarly to
<tt>increment</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>options</tt> is not valid for all constructor signatures described by
29.11.13.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/fs.rec.dir.itr.members">[fs.rec.dir.itr.members]</a> para 2.</p></li>
<li><p>the copies and moves don't specify what they actually <i>do</i></p></li>
<li><p>it's not quite kosher for the copies and moves to have postconditions on the value of
expressions that have UB if the iterator copied/moved from is not dereferenceable.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><i>[2018-06, Rapperswil, Wednesday evening]</i></p>

<p>
JW: p21 currently can just say "unspecified"<br/>
BO: if we are OK with only remote implementations we can remove the unspecifiedness<br/>

<p><i>[2016-06, Oulu &mdash; Daniel comments and provides new wording]</i></p>

<p>
During the LWG discussion of this issue it has been observed, that the interpretation of the embedded <i>see below</i>
is not really clear and that we should split declaration and definition of the new overloads, so that we have a place
that allows us to specify what "<i>see below</i>" stands for. In addition, the new wording wraps the "<i>see below</i>"
as "<tt>size_type(<i>see below</i>)</tt>" to clarify the provided expression type, similar as we did for the default
constructor of <tt>unordered_map</tt>.
</p>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
I've received this report at the <a href="mailto:cxxeditor@gmail.com">project editor mail alias</a>, and it seems like it may be worthy of a LWG issue:
</p>
<blockquote class="note">
<p>
I recently had this problem: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>I was storing data in a vector of <tt>__uint128_t</tt>s</li>
<li>I used a sorting library which used <tt>numeric_limits&lt;T&gt;::max()</tt> as a sentinel value</li>
<li>GCC's libstdc++ provides a <tt>numeric_limits</tt> specialisation for that type, but</li>
<li>Clang's libc++ does not.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This broke the sorting for me on different platforms, and it was quite difficult to determine why. If the default 
<tt>numeric_limits</tt> didn't default to <tt>0</tt>s and <tt>false</tt> values (18.3.2.4 of N4582), and instead 
<tt>static_assert</tt>ed, causing my code to not compile, I would have found the solution immediately.
<p/>
I know that <tt>__uint128_t</tt> is non-standard, so neither GCC nor Clang is doing the wrong thing nor the right thing 
here. I could just submit a patch to libc++ providing the specialisations, but it doesn't fix the problem at its core.
<p/>
I am wondering, what is the rationale behind the defaults being <tt>0</tt> and <tt>false</tt>? It seems like it is 
inviting a problem for any future numeric types, whether part of a library, compiler extension, and possibly even 
future updates to C++'s numeric types. I think it would be much better to prevent code that tries to use 
unspecified <tt>numeric_limits</tt> from compiling.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
An alternative to this suggestion would be to still define the primary template, but not provide any of the members 
except <tt>is_specialized</tt>. Either way, this would make <tt>numeric_limits</tt> members SFINAEable.
<p/>
Along the same lines, one might wonder why the members that only make sense for floating-point types are required to 
be defined to nonsense values for integer types.

<p>
It should be considered whether the description of the
single-object allocation functions should say "or smaller", like
the array allocation functions. For example, according to 17.6.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/new.delete.single">[new.delete.single]</a> p1 (emphasis mine):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The allocation function (3.7.4.1) called by a new-expression (5.3.4) to allocate <tt>size</tt> bytes of
storage suitably aligned to represent any object <em>of that size</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In contrast to this, 17.6.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/new.delete.array">[new.delete.array]</a> p1 says (emphasis mine):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The allocation function (3.7.4.1) called by the array form of a new-expression (5.3.4) to allocate
<tt>size</tt> bytes of storage suitably aligned to represent any array object <em>of that size or smaller</em>. 
(footnote: It is not the direct responsibility of <tt>operator new[](std::size_t)</tt> or <tt>operator delete[](void*)</tt> 
to note the repetition count or element size of the array. Those operations are performed elsewhere in the array 
<tt>new</tt> and <tt>delete</tt> expressions. The array <tt>new</tt> expression, may, however, increase the size 
argument to operator <tt>new[](std::size_t)</tt> to obtain space to store supplemental information.)

<p>
This seems to date from the days of adaptable function objects with an <tt>argument_type</tt> typedef, but in 
modern C++ the predicate might not have an argument type. It could have a function template that accepts various 
arguments, so it doesn't make sense to state requirements in terms of a type that isn't well defined.
</p>

<p><i>[2016-07, Toronto Saturday afternoon issues processing]</i></p>

<p>The proposed resolution needs to be updated because the underlying wording has changed. 
Also, since the sequence is homogeneous, we shouldn't have to say that the expression is well-formed
for all elements in the range; that implies that it need not be well-formed if the range is empty.</p>

<p><i>[2019-03-17; Daniel comments and removes previous wording]</i></p>

<p>
In the recent working draft <a href="https://wg21.link/n4810">N4810</a> all the "shall be convertible to <tt>Predicate</tt>'s 
argument type" are gone - they were cleaned up when "The One Range" proposal <a href="https://wg21.link/p0896r4">P0896R4</a> 
had been accepted in San Diego 2018.
<p/>
I also believe that we don't need the extra wording that was suggested in the previous P/R (effectively the need to say 
that the expression <tt>pred(*i)</tt> is well-formed), because this follows (in a more general way) by the expression 
<tt>invoke(pred, invoke(proj, e))</tt> that is applied to the elements <tt>e</tt> of <tt>[first, last)</tt>.
<p/>
Therefore I'm suggesting that the resolution for this issue should be: Resolved by <a href="https://wg21.link/p0896r4">P0896R4</a>.

<p>
The private members of <tt>node_handle</tt> are missing the usual "exposition only" comment. As a consequence, 
<tt>ptr_</tt> and <tt>alloc_</tt> now appear to be names defined by the library (so programs defining these names 
as macros before including a library header have undefined behavior).
<p/>
Presumably this is unintentional and these members should be considered to be for exposition only.
<p/>
It's also not clear whether the name <tt>node_handle</tt> is reserved for library usage or not; 
22.2.4.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/container.node.overview">[container.node.overview]</a>/3 says the implementation need not provide a type with this name, but 
doesn't seem to rule out the possibility that an implementation will choose to do so regardless.
</p>
<p>

<p/>
A similar problem seems to exist for the exposition-only type <tt><i>call_wrapper</i></tt> from 
<a href="http://wg21.link/p0358r1">p0358r1</a>, which exposes a private data member named <tt>fd</tt> and 
a typedef <tt>FD</tt>.

<p>Jonathan says that we need to make clear that the name <tt>node_handle</tt> is not reserved</p>

<p><i>[2019-03-17; Daniel comments and provides wording]</i></p>

<p>
Due to an editorial step, the previous name <tt>node_handle</tt>/<tt><i>node_handle</i></tt> has been replaced 
by the artificial <tt><i>node-handle</i></tt> name, so I see no longer any reason to talk about a
name <tt>node_handle</tt> reservation. The provided wording therefore only takes care of the private

Why the inconsistency? Should all the cases have a SFINAE requirement?

<p>
The C++14 standard contains no language that guarantees the deleter run by a
<tt>shared_ptr</tt> will see all associated <tt>weak_ptr</tt> instances as expired. For example,
the standard doesn't appear to guarantee that the assertion in the following
snippet won't fire:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::weak_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; weak;
std::shared_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; strong{
  new Foo,
  [&amp;weak] (Foo* f) {
    assert(weak.expired());
    delete f;
  },
};

weak = strong;
strong.reset();
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
It seems clear that the intent is that associated <tt>weak_ptr</tt>s are expired,
because otherwise <tt>shared_ptr</tt> deleters could resurrect a reference to an object
that is being deleted.
<p/>
Suggested fix: 20.11.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.shared.dest">[util.smartptr.shared.dest]</a> should specify that the decrease in
<tt>use_count()</tt> caused by the destructor is sequenced before the call to the
deleter or the call to <tt>delete p</tt>.
</p>

<p><i>[2016-11-08, Jonathan and STL suggest NAD]</i></p>

<p>
STL and Jonathan feel that the example has unspecified behaviour, and the
assertion is allowed to fire, and that's OK (the program's expectation
is not reasonable). Otherwise it's necessary to move-construct a copy
of the deleter and use that copy to destroy the owned pointer. We do
not want to be required to do that.
</p>
<p>See also <a href="2262">2262</a>.</p>

<p><i>[2017-09-20, Jonathan comments]</i></p>

<p>
I'd like to withdraw my NAD suggestion. The value of <tt>use_count()</tt> is already observable during the destructor via 
<tt>shared_ptr</tt> and <tt>weak_ptr</tt> objects that share ownership, so specifying when it changes ensures correct 
behaviour.

Related: <a href="2748">2748</a> swappable traits for optionals, <a href="2749">2749</a> swappable traits for variants.
</p>
<p>
The adoption of <a href="http://wg21.link/p0185r1">P0185R1</a> "Adding [nothrow-]swappable traits" makes certain 
non-swappable types indirectly swappable. Consider a type defined as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct non_swappable {
  friend void swap(non_swappable&amp;, non_swappable&amp;) = delete;
};

non_swappable ns1, ns2;
using std::swap;
swap(ns1, ns2); // ill-formed

static_assert(std::is_swappable_v&lt;non_swappable&gt; == false); // holds
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Lvalues of type <tt>non_swappable</tt> are not swappable, as defined by 16.5.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/swappable.requirements">[swappable.requirements]</a>, 
overload resolution selects the deleted function. Consistently, <tt>is_swappable_v&lt;non_swappable&gt;</tt> yields 
false. It should be noted that since <tt>non_swappable</tt> is move constructible and move assignable, a qualified 
call to <tt>std::swap</tt> would be well-formed, even under P0185. Now consider the following snippet:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::tuple&lt;non_swappable&gt; tns1, tns2;
using std::swap;
swap(tns1, tns2); // previously ill-formed, now well-formed

static_assert(std::is_swappable_v&lt;std::tuple&lt;non_swappable&gt;&gt; == false); // fires
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Before P0185, this snippet would violate the implicit requirement of specialized swap for tuples that each tuple 
element be swappable. After P0185, this specialized swap overload for tuples would be SFINAEd away, resulting 
in overload resolution selecting the base swap overload, and performing the exchange via move construction and 
move assignment of tuples.
<p/>
This issue affects all of <tt>pair</tt>, <tt>tuple</tt>, <tt>unique_ptr</tt>, <tt>array</tt>, <tt>queue</tt>, 
<tt>priority_queue</tt>, <tt>stack</tt>, and should eventually also apply to <tt>optional</tt> and <tt>variant</tt>.

<p>
I think there's a minor defect in the <tt>std::function</tt> interface. The constructor template is:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class F&gt; function(F f);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
while the assignment operator template is 
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class F&gt; function&amp; operator=(F&amp;&amp; f);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The latter came about as a result of LWG <a href="1288">1288</a>, but that one was dealing with a specific issue that 
wouldn't have affected the constructor. I think the constructor should also take <tt>f</tt> by forwarding reference, 
this saves a move in the lvalue/xvalue cases and is also just generally more consistent. Should just make sure 
that it's stored as <tt>std::decay_t&lt;F&gt;</tt> instead of <tt>F</tt>. 
<p/>
Is there any reason to favor a by-value constructor over a forwarding-reference constructor?
</p>

<p>
Throughout <tt>optional</tt>/<tt>variant</tt>/<tt>any</tt>'s specification references are made to "the selected constructor 
of <tt>T</tt>". For example, 20.6.3.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/optional.ctor">[optional.ctor]</a>/16 says of the constructor from <tt>const T&amp;</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
-16- <i>Remarks:</i> If <tt>T</tt>'s selected constructor is a <tt>constexpr</tt> constructor, this constructor shall be a 
<tt>constexpr</tt> constructor.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Similarly, the in-place constructor has this wording (20.6.3.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/optional.ctor">[optional.ctor]</a>/25-26):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
-25- <i>Throws:</i> Any exception thrown by the selected constructor of <tt>T</tt>.
<p/>
-26- <i>Remarks:</i> If <tt>T</tt>'s constructor selected for the initialization is a <tt>constexpr</tt> constructor, 
this constructor shall be a <tt>constexpr</tt> constructor.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
If <tt>T</tt> is a scalar type, it has no constructor at all. Moreover, even for 
class types, the in-place constructor wording ignores any implicit conversion done on the argument before the selected 
constructor is called, which 1) may not be valid in constant expressions and 2) may throw an exception; such exceptions 
aren't thrown "by the selected constructor of <tt>T</tt>" but outside it.
<p/>
The wording should probably be recast to refer to the entire initialization.

<p>
If a <tt>std::function</tt> has a reference as a return type, and that reference binds to a prvalue 
returned by the callable that it wraps, then the reference is always dangling. Because any use of such 
a reference results in undefined behaviour, the <tt>std::function</tt> should not be allowed to be 
initialized with such a callable. Instead, the program should be ill-formed.
<p/>
A minimal example of well-formed code under the current standard that exhibits this issue:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;functional&gt;

int main() 
{
  std::function&lt;const int&amp;()&gt; F([]{ return 42; });
  int x = F(); // oops!
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p><i>[2016-11-22, David Krauss comments and suggests wording]</i></p>

<p>
Indirect bindings may also introduce temporaries inside <tt>std::function</tt>, e.g.:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void f(std::function&lt;long const&amp;()&gt;); // Retains an observer to a long.

void g() {
  int v;
  f([&amp;]()-&gt;int&amp; { return v; } ); // int lvalue binds to long const&amp; through a temporary.
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
A fix has been implemented. Conversions that may be conversion operators are allowed, though, because those can 
produce legitimate glvalues. Before adopting this, it need to be considered considered whether there should be 
SFINAE or a hard error.

we decided to remove the proposed guarantee that <tt>quick_exit</tt> be made signal safe.
<p/>
Our reasoning is that functions registered with <tt>at_quick_exit</tt> aren't forbidden from calling 
<tt>quick_exit</tt>, but <tt>quick_exit</tt> implementations likely acquire some form of a lock before 
processing all registered functions (because a note forbids the implementation from introducing data races).
<p/>
The following code can therefore deadlock:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;

int main() 
{
  std::at_quick_exit([] () { std::quick_exit(0); });
  std::quick_exit(1);
  return 0;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The same applies if a function registered in <tt>at_quick_exit</tt> handles a signal, and that signal calls 
<tt>quick_exit</tt>. SG1 believes that both issues (same thread deadlock, and signal deadlock) can be resolved 
in the same manner. Either:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify that calling <tt>quick_exit</tt> while servicing <tt>quick_exit</tt> is undefined; or</li>
<li>Specifying that calling <tt>quick_exit</tt> while servicing <tt>quick_exit</tt> is defined to not deadlock, 
and instead calls <tt>_Exit</tt> without calling further registered functions.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Option 2. seems preferable, and can be implemented along the lines of:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;array&gt;
#include &lt;atomic&gt;
#include &lt;cstddef&gt;

namespace {

  typedef void (*func)();
  
  std::array&lt;func, 32&gt; quick_exit_functions;
  
  const auto* quick_exit_functions_ptr = &amp;quick_exit_functions;
  
  std::atomic_flag lock = ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT;
  
  struct scope 
  {
    scope() { while (lock.test_and_set(std::memory_order_acquire)) ; }
    ~scope() { lock.clear(std::memory_order_release); }
  };
  
}

namespace std {

  extern "C" void quick_exit(int status) noexcept
  {
    decltype(quick_exit_functions_ptr) f;
    {
      scope s;
      f = quick_exit_functions_ptr;
      quick_exit_functions_ptr = nullptr;
    }
    if (f) {
      size_t pos = f-&gt;size();
      while (pos &gt; 0)
        (*f)[--pos]();
    }
    _Exit(status);
  }
  
  extern "C++" int at_quick_exit(func f) noexcept
  {
    scope s;
    if (!quick_exit_functions_ptr || quick_exit_functions.size() == quick_exit_functions.max_size())
      return -1;
    quick_exit_functions[quick_exit_functions.size()] = f;
    return 0;
  }

}

<p>
I would like clarification from LWG regarding the various limit macros like <tt>INT_8_MIN</tt> in <tt>&lt;cstdint&gt;</tt>, 
in pursuit of editorial cleanup of this header's synopsis. I have two questions:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>At present, macros like <tt>INT_8_MIN</tt> that correspond to the optional type <tt>int8_t</tt> are required 
(unconditionally), whereas the underlying type to which they appertain is only optional. Is this deliberate? 
Should the macros also be optional?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it deliberate that C++ only specifies sized aliases for the sizes 8, 16, 32 and 64, whereas the corresponding 
C header allows type aliases and macros for arbitrary sizes for implementations that choose to provide extended integer 
types? Is the C++ wording more restrictive by accident?</p></li>

<p>C11 ties the macro names to the existence of the types. Marshall to research the second question.</p>
<p>Close <a href="2764">2764</a> as a duplicate of this issue.</p>

<p><i>[2017-03-18, Thomas comments and provides wording]</i></p>

<p>
This is as close as I can get to the C wording without resolving part (a) of the issue (whether we deliberately don't 
allow sized type aliases for sizes other than 8, 16, 32, 64, a departure from C). Once we resolve part (a), we need 
to revisit <tt>&lt;cinttypes&gt;</tt> and fix up the synopsis (perhaps to get rid of <tt>N</tt>) and add similar 
wording as the one below to make the formatting macros for the fixed-width types optional. For historical interest,
this issue is related to LWG <a href="553">553</a> and LWG <a href="841">841</a>.

<p><i>[2019-03-11; Reflector review and improved wording]</i></p>

<p>
Wording simplifications due to new general two's complement requirements of integer types; removal of wording
redundancies and applying some typo fixes in macro names.
</p>

<p><i>[2019-03-16; Daniel comments and updates wording]</i></p>

<p>
Hubert Tong pointed out that we do not have a statement about <tt>[U]INTPTR_{MIN|MAX}</tt> being optional.
Interestingly, the C11 Standard does not say directly that the <tt>[U]INTPTR_{MIN|MAX}</tt> macros are optional,
but this follows indirectly from the fact that <tt>intptr_t</tt> and <tt>uintptr_t</tt> are indeed optional. 
The updated wording therefore realizes Hubert's suggestion.
<p/>
In addition, the reference document has been rebased to <a href="http://wg21.link/n4810">N4810</a>, because
that draft version contains an <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/pull/2638">editorial change</a>, 
which renames the term "range exponent" of integer types to "width", which is the vocabulary used below and
also matches C's use.
<p/>
Finally, Hubert Tong suggested the following rewording replacements of
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If and only if the implementation defines such a typedef name, it also defines the corresponding macros.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
to:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Each of the macros listed in this subclause is defined if and only if the implementation defines the corresponding typedef name.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
and of
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<tt>PRI</tt> macros that use the placeholder N are defined if and only if the implementation actually defines the 
corresponding typedef name in 17.4.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/cstdint.syn">[cstdint.syn]</a>. <tt>SCN</tt> macros that use the placeholder <tt><i>N</i></tt> 
are defined if and only if the implementation actually defines the corresponding typedef name and the implementation 
has a suitable <tt>fscanf</tt> length modifier for the type.

typedef name in 17.4.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/cstdint.syn">[cstdint.syn]</a>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Those changes have been applied as well.
</p>

<p><i>[2019-03-26; Reflector discussion and minor wording update]</i></p>

<p>
Geoffrey pointed out that the revised wording has the effect that it requires an implementation to define <tt>SCN</tt>
macros for all mentioned typedefs, but the C11 standard says "the corresponding <tt>fscanf</tt> macros shall be
defined unless the implementation does not have a suitable <tt>fscanf</tt> length modifier for the type.". An additional 
wording update repairs this problem below.

<p><i>[2017-01-30  Ville comments:]</i></p>

<p>Seems like the problem is resolved by a simple deduction guide:</p>
<pre>template &lt;class T&gt; optional(T) -&gt; optional&lt;T&gt;;</pre>
<p>The paper <a href="https://wg21.link/p0433r0">p0433r0</a> seems to suggest a different guide,</p>
<pre>template&lt;class T&gt; optional(T&amp;&amp; t) -&gt; optional&lt;remove_reference_t&lt;T&gt;&gt;;</pre>
<p>but I don't think the paper is up to speed with LWG <a href="2756">2756</a>. There's no reason
to use such an universal reference in the guide and <tt>remove_reference</tt> in its
target, just guide with <tt>T</tt>, with the target <tt>optional&lt;T&gt;</tt>, <tt>optional</tt>'s constructors
do the right thing once the type has been deduced.

Should the assert pass? Implementations disagree.
<p/>
Per 20.15.4.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/meta.unary.prop">[meta.unary.prop]</a>'s Table 38, this trait looks at whether the following variable definition is

<p>
... where <tt>Args</tt> is an empty pack in this case. That variable definition results in a call to the <tt>S</tt> destructor. 
Should that call be considered by the trait?

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The library has lots of functions declared <tt>constexpr</tt>, but it's not clear what that means. The <tt>constexpr</tt> 
keyword implies that there needs to be <em>some</em> invocation of the function, for <em>some</em> set of template 
arguments and function arguments, that is valid in a constant expression (otherwise the program would be ill-formed, 
with no diagnostic required), along with a few side conditions. I suspect the library intends to require something a 
lot stronger than that from implementations (something along the lines of "all calls that could reasonably be constant 
subexpressions are in fact constant subexpressions, unless otherwise stated").
<p/>
[variant.ctor]/1 contains this, which should also be fixed:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"This function shall be <tt>constexpr</tt> if and only if the value-initialization of the alternative type <tt>T0</tt> 
would satisfy the requirements for a <tt>constexpr</tt> function."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is the wrong constraint: instead of constraining whether the function is <tt>constexpr</tt>, we should constrain 
whether a call to it is a constant subexpression.

<p>
LWG <a href="2468">2468</a>'s resolution added to <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> the requirement to tolerate self-move-assignment, 
but that does nothing for library types that aren't explicitly specified to meet <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> other than make 
those types not meet <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> any longer.
<p/>
To realize the intent here, we need to carve out an exception to 16.5.4.9 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/res.on.arguments">[res.on.arguments]</a>'s restriction for 
move assignment operators and specify that self-move-assignment results in valid but unspecified state unless otherwise 
specified. The proposed wording below adds that to 16.5.5.15 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/lib.types.movedfrom">[lib.types.movedfrom]</a> since it seems to fit well with the

<p>
If we write <tt>a_uniq.insert(i, j)</tt> and <tt>[i, j)</tt> has multiple elements with keys that compare equivalent, 
which ones get inserted? Consider, for example, inserting into a <tt>map&lt;string, int&gt;</tt> with
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
m.insert({{"red", 5}, {"green", 3}, {"red", 7}, {"blue", 2}, {"pink", 6}});
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Which value for <tt>"red"</tt> will the map have?
<p/>
On my implementation we got <tt>"red" -&gt; 5</tt>, and I suspect that's true on most or all implementations, but I don't believe 
that's guaranteed by anything in the requirements. The wording in Table 90 just says that it "inserts each element from 
the range <tt>[i, j)</tt> if and only if there is no element with key equivalent to the key of that element", but that 
doesn't tell us what happens if <tt>[i, j)</tt> contains duplicate keys because it doesn't say what order the insertions 
are performed in. The standard should either guarantee that the first value is the one that gets inserted, or explicitly 
say that this is unspecified.
<p/>
The same issue applies to the range constructor, and to the unordered associative containers.

In [cmplx.over] and [cmath.syn], when talking about "sufficient additional overloads", we use the phrase
"effectively cast", but that is not a defined term.
<p/>
A hostile interpretation could read "<tt>reinterpret_cast</tt>" here.

Likely we mean "apply floating-point promotions, floating-integral
conversions, and floating-point conversions", but that should be
spelled out somewhere, e.g. in the library definitions section.

the <tt>sin</tt> function: One taking a <tt>float</tt>, one taking a <tt>double</tt>,
and one taking a <tt>long double</tt>. However, there is no statement that <tt>sin(long double)</tt> 
should actually invoke <tt>sinl</tt>, presumably delivering extra precision.
<p/>
An implementation like
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
inline long double sin(long double x)
{ return sinf(x); }
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
seems to satisfy the "effectively cast" requirement, but is certainly unintentional.
<p/>
The same issue arises for all math functions inherited from C.

20.12.5.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/mem.res.pool.options">[mem.res.pool.options]</a> p3 talks about a "pass-through-threshold".
<p/>
First, the phrase is not defined and it seems it could be easily avoided given the context.
<p/>
Second, given the phrasing here, it seems the implementation is essentially allowed to 
ignore the value <tt>largest_required_pool_block</tt> as it sees fit. It is unclear whether 
that is the intention.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Further to LWG <a href="2472">2472</a>, the case of <tt>reverse_iterator</tt> comparisons is a regression introduced 
by LWG <a href="280">280</a>.
<p/>
Consider the following program:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;utility&gt;
#include &lt;iterator&gt;

using namespace std::rel_ops;

bool f(std::reverse_iterator&lt;int *&gt; it) { return it != it; }
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Under C++03, the <tt>operator!=</tt> in lib.reverse.iterator is more specialized than the <tt>operator!=</tt> in <tt>std::rel_ops</tt>.
<p/>
Following LWG <a href="280">280</a>, neither <tt>operator!=</tt> candidate is more specialized than the other. The program is 
observed to fail with libc++.
<p/>
Online compiler example, see <a href="http://melpon.org/wandbox/permlink/aeOn1wiOi2CRKwwc">here</a>.
<p/>
Suggested resolution:
<p/>
Reintroduce the homogeneous comparison operators from C++03 alongside the new ones.

<p>
The standard library should provide <tt>string_view</tt> parameters instead or in addition for functions defined with 
<tt>char const *</tt> or <tt>string const &amp;</tt> as parameter types. Most notably in cases where both such 
overloads exist or where an internal copy is expected anyway.
</p>
<p>
It might be doubted that the non-null termination of <tt>string_view</tt> could be an issue with functions that pass 
the <tt>char *</tt> down to OS functions, such as <tt>fstream_buf::open()</tt> etc. and those shouldn't provide it 
and favour generating a <tt>std::string</tt> temporary instead in that case. However, <tt>std::path</tt> demonstrates 
it is usable to have <tt>string_view</tt> overloads and there might be many places where it can be handy, or even better.

<p>The relational operators of optional and variant completely reflect the semantics of the element types; this is inconsistent 
with other types in the library, like <tt>pair</tt>, <tt>tuple</tt> and containers. If we believe it's important that we don't 
synthesize relational operators for wrapper types, we should believe it's important for other types as well. Otherwise comparing 
containers of floating-point types and tuples/pairs etc. of floating point types will give incorrect answers.</p>
<p>Proposed change: Make the relational operators of containers and utility components reflect the semantics of the operators for the underlying element types.</p>

<p>
It seems that <tt>std::next</tt> is missing an optimization opportunity when taking a single parameter. The standard 
mandates that <tt>std::next</tt> shall call <tt>std::advance</tt> on the passed iterator and return it. For random-access 
iterators, it means that <tt>operator+=</tt> will be called on the iterator. However, if a single-argument overload was 
added to <tt>std::next</tt>, it could call <tt>++it</tt> directly instead of <tt>std::advance(it, 1)</tt>, which means 
that <tt>operator++</tt> would be called instead of <tt>operator+=</tt>. This might make a small performance difference 
for complicated iterators such as <tt>std::deque</tt>'s ones, where <tt>operator++</tt> has a simpler logic than 
<tt>operator+=</tt>.
<p/>
An equivalent optimization could be allowed by adding a single-argument overload to <tt>std::prev</tt> too.

Jonathan suggested NAD, because the proposed "just use increment when <tt>n==1</tt>" optimization can be done in 
<tt>std::next</tt> (and/or <tt>std::advance</tt>, and/or complicated iterators like <tt>deque::iterator</tt>) without 
adding an overload. Billy said the overload would avoid metaprogramming costs for dispatching to the right 
<tt>std::advance</tt>, and help in non-optimized builds. Zhihao said the overload would make it clear to users that 
the <tt>n==1</tt> case is optimized (Jonathan thinks this is irrelevant as there's no requirement that we tell users

The current PR for LWG <a href="2773">2773</a> changes <tt>std::ignore</tt> to be a <tt>constexpr</tt> variable. However it says 
nothing about whether using <tt>std::ignore</tt> in <tt>std::tie</tt> is a constant expression. I think the intent was clearly 
to allow this. Therefore I suggest we update the resolution to explicitly call this out in a note. (I don't think new normative 
wording is needed).
<p/>
I propose we update the current PR as follows:
</p>

<p>
Perhaps LWG feels the existing wording is clear enough, but if not I think the above changes sufficiently clarify it.
<p/>
The ability to <tt>constexpr</tt> assign to <tt>std::ignore</tt> can be important: Here is an extremely contrived example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>

<p>
LWG <a href="2797">2797</a> (RU 2) suggests that certain type-traits should be required to
diagnose violations of their pre-conditions. The basic idea is founded and I see no problems for
requiring this for the mentioned traits <tt>alignment_of</tt> or <tt>is_base_of</tt>,
for example. But if we want to require this diagnostics for some other traits, such as <tt>is_convertible</tt>,
<tt>is_constructible</tt> (and friends), or <tt>is_callable</tt> (and possibly some others), we really should
be sure that our current requirements are OK. 
<p/>
Unfortunately, there exists some cases, where we currently overspecify imposing complete type requirements where they
are not actually required. For example, for the following situation the answer of the trait could 
be given without ever needing the complete type of <tt>X</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct X; // Never defined

static_assert(std::is_convertible_v&lt;X, const X&amp;&gt;);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Unfortunately we cannot <em>always</em> allow incomplete types, because most type constructions or conversions indeed
require a complete type, so <em>generally</em> relaxing the current restrictions is also not an option.
<p/>
The core language has a solution for this "small" gap of situations, where the response of the compiler <em>might</em>
depend on type completeness: Undefined behaviour. So, I believe we need a somewhat more detailled form to express the
intend here. Informally, I would suggest that the program should only be ill-formed in the situation described by 
LWG <a href="2797">2797</a>, if there exists the <em>possibility</em> that the compiler would require complete types for the
considered operation. The example shown above, <tt>std::is_convertible_v&lt;X, const X&amp;&gt;</tt>, would <b>never</b>
require the need to complete <tt>X</tt>, so here no violation should exist.
<p/>
The presented example might seem a tiny one, but the Standard Library type traits are extreme fundamental tools and we should
try to not give the impression that an approximate rule of the current type constraints breaks reasonable code.
<p/>
It is correct, that above example has currently undefined behaviour due to the breakage of pre-conditions, therefore
this issue suggests to fix the current situation <em>before</em> enforcing a diagnostic for such valid situations.

<p>
In 29.11.9.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/fs.enum.path.format">[fs.enum.path.format]</a> "always interpreted in the same way" means
irrespective of the <tt>path::format</tt> value, or the content of the string.
Maybe add ", rather than depending on the <tt>path::format</tt> value or the
content of the character sequence".
<p/>
In 99 [fs.class.directory_iterator] an "implementation-defined
directory-like file type" is an implementation-defined file type (see
99 [fs.enum.file_type] and Table 115) that is treated like a directory by
the special rules that the OS has for non-regular files (see 29.11.7.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/fs.path.generic">[fs.path.generic]</a>).
<p/>
In 29.11.14.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/fs.op.copy">[fs.op.copy]</a>, an "implementation-defined file type" is exactly
that, see 99 [fs.enum.file_type] and Table 115 again. I don't see what
isn't clear about that. Maybe add a cross-reference to 99 [fs.enum.file_type].

It is not always made explicit whether the requirement is referring to time or space complexity, or both.

<p>
According to 20.14.14.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/func.bind.bind">[func.bind.bind]</a>/1.2,
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<tt>fd</tt> is an lvalue of type <tt>FD</tt> constructed from <tt>std::forward&lt;F&gt;(f)</tt>,
</p></blockquote>
<p>
and then uses <tt>fd</tt> throughout the specification, seemingly without
regard to the <i>cv</i>-qualification of the call wrapper <tt>g</tt>. But this
definition means that <tt>fd</tt> is always <i>cv</i>-unqualified, rather than having
its <i>cv</i>-qualification change with that of <tt>g</tt> as intended.
<p/>
LWG <a href="2545">2545</a> accidentally exacerbated the problem by removing any hint that
<tt>fd</tt>'s <i>cv</i>-qualifier followed that of the call wrapper.
<p/>
A similar issue affects the type of <tt>td<sub><i>i</i></sub></tt> for nested binds.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The standard requires that <tt>char_traits&lt;char16_t&gt;::int_type</tt> is
<tt>uint_least16_t</tt>, so when that has the same representation as <tt>char16_t</tt>
there are no bits left to represent the <tt>eof</tt> value.
<p/>
21.2.3.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/char.traits.specializations.char16.t">[char.traits.specializations.char16.t]</a> says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&mdash; The member <tt>eof()</tt> shall return an implementation-defined constant
that cannot appear as a valid UTF-16 code unit.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Existing practice is to use the "noncharacter" <tt>u'\uffff'</tt> for this
value, but the Unicode spec is clear that <tt>U+FFFF</tt> and other
noncharacters are valid, and their appearance in a UTF-16 string does
not make it ill-formed. See <a href="http://www.unicode.org/faq/private_use.html#nonchar7">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/faq/private_use.html#nonchar8">here</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>The fact that they are called "noncharacters" and are not intended for open interchange does not mean 
that they are somehow illegal or invalid code points which make strings containing them invalid.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In practice this means there's no way to tell if
<tt>basic_streambuf&lt;char16_t&gt;::sputc(u'\uffff')</tt> succeeded or not. If it
can insert the character it returns <tt>to_int_type(u'\uffff')</tt> and
otherwise it returns <tt>eof()</tt>, which is the same value.
<p/>
I believe that <tt>char_traits&lt;char16_t&gt;::to_int_type(char_type c)</tt> can be
defined to transform <tt>U+FFFF</tt> into <tt>U+FFFD</tt>, so that the invariant
<tt>eq_int_type(eof(), to_int_type(c)) == false</tt> holds for any <tt>c</tt> (and the
return value of <tt>sputc</tt> will be distinct from <tt>eof</tt>). I don't think any
implementation currently meets that invariant.
<p/>
I think at the very least we need to correct the statement "The member
<tt>eof()</tt> shall return an implementation-defined constant that cannot
appear as a valid UTF-16 code unit", because there are no such
constants if <tt>sizeof(uint_least16_t) == sizeof(char16_t)</tt>.
<p/>
This issue is closely related to LWG <a href="1200">1200</a>, but there it's a
slightly different statement of the problem, and neither the
submitter's recommendation nor the proposed resolution solves this
issue here. It seems that was closed as NAD before the Unicode corrigendum
existed, so at the time our standard just gave "surprising results"
but wasn't strictly wrong. Now it makes a normative statement that
conflicts with Unicode.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In Table 95 in 23.3.5.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/input.iterators">[input.iterators]</a>, it is specified that the expression <tt>*a</tt> returns <tt>reference</tt>, 
which must be convertible to <tt>value_type</tt>. This is not true for move-only types, which incidentally means that
<tt>std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt;&gt;</tt> does not possess even a lowly <tt>InputIterator</tt>, which is, of 
course, absurd.
<p/>
With the advent of concepts as first-class citizens in the language, getting this right as soon as possible is a priority.
<p/>
This issue seems to be similar to both LWG <a href="448">448</a> and LWG <a href="484">484</a>, but not the same.
<p/>
The proposed resolution stems from two considerations outlined below:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Convertibility is too strong for all algorithms</b>
<p/>
No algorithm in the standard library requires convertibility to <tt>value_type</tt>. If algorithms require things that smell 
of that, they specify the assignment or constructibility flavor they need directly. I checked this by going through the 
specification of each and every one of them in <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;numeric&gt;</tt>, which highlighted 
several issues unrelated to this one. These issues are presented in <em>Algorithms with underspecified iterator requirements</em>
(LWG <a href="2963">2963</a>).
<p/>
<b><tt>reference</tt> needs to be related to <tt>value_type</tt></b>
<p/>
Algorithms need this for the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>lifetime-extension: served as adequately by <tt>T const&amp;</tt> as by <tt>T</tt>. Also works for iterators that 
return by value. <tt>T&amp;&amp;</tt> also correctly binds to <tt>T const&amp;</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>passing to predicates: again, served adequately by <tt>T const&amp;</tt></p></li>
<li><p>writing to <tt>*result</tt>: not provided by the requirement anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>capture-by-copy: currently implicitly guaranteed, but unused in the standard library (always specified separately). 
A separate specification can always be made for algorithms that need to capture-by-copy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
We must give due consideration to code that so far required its inputs to be <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> implicitly by 
requiring convertibility to <tt>T</tt>. This is done in the issue LWG <a href="2963">2963</a>, 
which presents the results of a comb-through of <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;numeric&gt;</tt> to find algorithms 
that have this requirement, but where it is not specified. While related issues have been identified, no algorithms seems 
to require more than <tt>T const&amp;</tt> convertibility without separately requiring convertibility to <tt>T</tt>.
<p/>
Since such code is already compiling today, relaxing this requirement does not break code.
<p/>
The only code this could possibly break is if, in a concept checking library, the <tt>InputIterator</tt> concept requirement 
on <tt>reference</tt> being convertible to <tt>value_type</tt> gets relaxed. Such a library, if it offered overloading based 
on most-specific modeled concept, could now, once fixed, resolve the call to a different algorithm, which could break user 
code that uses a hypothetical algorithm with a move-only container and was relying to select some other overload for move-only 
types based on the implicit <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> assertion provided by the iterator.
<p/>
In our internal concepts-checking library, we have had this issue "fixed" since the very beginning &mdash; move-only types 
were too important for our internal algorithms library, and also no algorithm in it seems to require something like 
<tt>Iterator::value_type x = *first</tt> without also requiring copy-constructibility anyway.

<p><i>[2018-04-20; Eric Niebler provides improved wording]</i></p>

<p>
The revised wording makes it clear that you can only rely on those operational semantics when 
the value type is constructible from the reference type and is movable. When those conditions 
aren't met, we can make no guarantees about the operational semantics of <tt>*r++</tt> (which 
is why <tt>*r++</tt> is no longer a required expression of the <tt>InputIterator</tt> concept 
in the Ranges TS).
<p/>
Really, <em>no</em> generic code should be doing <tt>*r++</tt> on input iterators. Another 
option would be to simply deprecate this requirement for input iterators, but that might need 
a paper. (For forward iterators, <tt>*r++</tt> is already required to return <tt>reference</tt> 
exactly, and the multi-pass guarantee gives it the proper semantics.)
<p/>
I also now have a question about the proposed return type of <tt>*a</tt> and <tt>*r++</tt>, 
which says they must be something that "binds to <tt>const T&amp;</tt>". Does this mean that an 
iterator with a reference type reference-to-[<tt>const</tt>?]-<tt>volatile</tt>-<tt>T</tt> is no longer 
considered an iterator? I don't think that's what we want to say. Perhaps these should read 
"binds to <tt>const volatile T&amp;</tt> instead, except that has the problem for InputIterators 
that return prvalues that a prvalue is not bindable to a volatile reference.

<p>
While researching whether the proposed resolution of Iterators of Containers of move-only types do not model <tt>InputIterator</tt>
(LWG <a href="2962">2962</a>), I came across several algorithms that underspecify their requirements, mostly with regard to some associated type of the iterator type they operate on. A list can be found below.
<p/>
The list of algorithms with underspecified requirements from <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;numeric&gt;</tt> follows.
<p/>
With the advent of concepts, these algorithms will need better specifications if we are ever hoping to be allowed to overload based on them. I want this issue to bring the standard algorithms closer to having their concept requirements directly transcribable to library annotations.

At the moment, <tt>inplace_merge</tt> requires exactly <tt><i>N</i> - 1</tt> comparisons, if enough additional memory is 
available (and in practice enough additional memory is always available). However, this prohibits implementing the 
merge operation using forms of binary search, as in Timsort's 
<a href="https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Objects/listsort.txt#l451">'Galloping Mode'</a>, a useful optimization 
for non-uniform input data. It's not really useful to prohibit standard libraries from trying a few extra speculative 
compares like this, given that users must be prepared for the fallback "not enough memory" 
&#x1d4aa;(<tt><i>N</i> lg <i>N</i></tt>) algorithm.

Whether you get "<tt>.99</tt>" or "<tt>0.99</tt>" for the following depends on the implementation:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::cout.imbue(std::locale("en_US"));
std::cout &lt;&lt; std::put_money(99.L);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
I don't see any justification in [locale.money.put.virtuals] for the leading <tt>0</tt>, although that seems more useful.
<p/>
If we want the leading zero, we should say so.

<h3><a name="2984" href="2984">2984.</a> <tt>put_money(99)</tt> is unnecessarily undefined</h3>

<p>
[ext.manip] p5 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires:</i> The type <tt>moneyT</tt> shall be either <tt>long double</tt> or a specialization of the 
<tt>basic_string</tt> template (Clause 24).
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This means that <tt>put_money(99)</tt>, <tt>put_money(99.)</tt>, <tt>put_money("99")</tt>, and 
<tt>put_money(string_view{"99"})</tt> are all undefined, when in practice they will compile fine and 
do the right thing, converting the argument to <tt>long double</tt> or <tt>std::string</tt> as needed.
<p/>
We could change it to be "otherwise the program is ill-formed", or to remove the function templates from overload 
resolution when the argument is not <tt>long double</tt> or a <tt>std::basic_string</tt>, but that will unnecessarily 
break code that works fine today. We should accept types convertible to <tt>long double</tt> or the relevant 
<tt>money_put</tt> facet's <tt>string_type</tt> (which is not known until we attempt to write the unspecified 
type to an ostream).
<p/>
The requirement is also insufficient, because <tt>cout &lt;&lt; put_money(wstring(L"99"))</tt> won't compile on any 
implementation, despite the argument type being a specialization of <tt>basic_string</tt>. This same problem exists 
for <tt>std::get_money</tt>.
</p>

<p><i>[2017-06-24, Daniel comments and provides wording]</i></p>

<p>
The wording changes below are supposed to support all <tt>moneyT</tt> types that are convertible to either 
<tt>long double</tt> or to <tt>money_put/get&lt;Ch, o/istreambuf_iterator&lt;Ch, Tr&gt;&gt;::string_type</tt> 
(but not to both), where <tt>Ch</tt> and <tt>Tr</tt> are determined by the concrete instantiated specialization of the 
exposition-only function template <tt>f</tt> that is used to specify the semantics of <tt>put_money</tt> and 
<tt>get_money</tt>, respectively. XOR-ing the requirements outlaws types that are convertible to both, which 
would cause an ambiguity unless we would provide wording that would introduce an ordered application of these 
convertibility constraints. This is the rationale for the seemingly odd new <i>Remarks</i> formulation. Note also,
that the wording provided below intentionally attempts to distinguish between the statically testable
conditions based on the <tt>is_convertible_v</tt> expressions within the <i>Remarks:</i> element and the well-defined 
runtime behaviour requirement of the actually provided argument of deduced type <tt>moneyT</tt> within the 
pre-existing <i>Requires:</i> element. Another point worth pointing out is that the wording attempts to fix an
currently existing ambiguity of the meaning of the type <tt>moneyT</tt> (and to a lesser extend for <tt>charT</tt> and
<tt>traits</tt>) as either the template parameter of <tt>put/get_money</tt> or that of the corresponding template
argument of the exposition-only <tt>f</tt> templates. The revised form makes it clearer that it refers to the latter.
<p/>
It should be emphasized that this extension of the current wording would provide support for <tt>put_money(99)</tt>, 
<tt>put_money(99.)</tt>, and <tt>put_money("99")</tt>, but <em>not</em> yet for <tt>put_money(string_view{"99"})</tt>, 
because <tt>string_view</tt> is not convertible to <tt>string</tt>. To realize support for the latter, this wording 
approach could be extended by referring to <tt>is_constructible</tt> instead of <tt>is_convertible</tt>, though.

The fine folks on our backend team suggested that we special case <tt>std::reverse</tt> of 1/2/4/8 to take 
advantage of vector units. Unfortunately, at present <tt>std::reverse</tt> says it does <tt>N/2 iter_swap</tt>s, 
which doesn't permit our vector implementation even if the iterator inputs are pointers to trivially copyable <tt>T</tt>s.
<p/>

<a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareMinigun/status/878150939512717312">~8x faster on Skylake</a> than the serial version,

<p>
The broadness of the above statement makes it sound like it is merely a statement of intent; however, this appears to 
be a necessary normative statement insofar as identifying the general semantics to be associated with the syntactic 
forms identified. In any case, if it is meant for <tt>ClassAtomCollatingElement</tt> to provide functionality equivalent 
to a collating symbol in a POSIX bracket expression, multi-character collating elements need to be considered.
<p/>
In [re.grammar] paragraph 14:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The behavior of the internal finite state machine representation when used to match a sequence of characters is 
as described in ECMA-262. The behavior is modified according to any <tt>match_flag_type</tt> flags specified when

by interaction with the traits class template parameter as follows: [bullets 14.1 to 14.4]

In none of the bullets does the wording handle multi-character collating elements in a clear manner:

of primary equivalence class specifies that it is a set of characters (not of collating elements).</p></li>
<li><p>14.4 deals in characters.</p></li>

<p>
For a user to implement a regular expression traits class meaningfully, the relationship between the return value of <tt>traits_inst.lookup_collatename</tt> to the behaviour of the finite state machine corresponding to a regular expression 
needs to be better specified.
<p/>
From <a href="https://wg21.link/n4660">N4660</a> subclause 31.13 [re.grammar], <tt>traits_inst.lookup_collatename</tt> 
only feeds clearly into two operations:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>a test if the returned string is empty ([re.grammar]/8), and</p></li>
<li><p>a test if the result of <tt>traits_inst.transform_primary</tt>, with the returned string, 
is empty ([re.grammar]/10).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>

it was in the original proposal.)

It should be, for two reasons: first, this would be consistent with the other three constructors

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
There are various problems with the specification of <tt>list::unique</tt> and its <tt>forward_list</tt> counterpart, some of which are obvious even on cursory inspection:
<ul>
<li>It refers to the identifiers <tt>first</tt> and <tt>last</tt>, which aren't even defined.</li>
<li>It uses <tt>i - 1</tt> on non-random-access iterators - in the case of <tt>forward_list</tt>, on forward-only iterators.</li>
<li>The resolution of LWG <a href="202">202</a>, changing the specification of <tt>std::unique</tt> to require an equivalence relation 
    and adjusting the order of comparison, weren't applied to these member functions.</li>
</ul>
<p/>
LWG <a href="491">491</a>, which pointed out many of those problems with the specification of <tt>list::unique</tt>, was closed as NAD with the rationale that
<blockquote>
"All implementations known to the author of this Defect Report comply with these assumption", and "no impact on current code is expected", i.e. there is no evidence of real-world confusion or harm.
</blockquote>
That implementations somehow managed to do the right thing in spite of obviously defective standardese doesn't seem like a good reason to not fix the defects.
</p>

<p><i>[2017-07 Toronto Tuesday PM issue prioritization]</i></p>

<p>Priority 3; by the way, there's general wording in 25.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/algorithms.requirements">[algorithms.requirements]</a> p10 that lets us specify iterator arithmetic as if we were using random access iterators.</p>
    
<p><i>[2017-07-11 Tim comments]</i></p>

<p>I drafted the P/R fully aware of the general wording in 25.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/algorithms.requirements">[algorithms.requirements]</a> p10. However, that general wording is limited to Clause 28, so to make use of the shorthand permitted
by that wording, we would need additional wording importing it to these subclauses.
<p/>
Moreover, that general wording only defines <tt>a+n</tt> and <tt>b-a</tt>; it notably doesn't define <tt>a-n</tt>, which is needed here. And one cannot merely define <tt>a-n</tt> as
<tt>a+(-n)</tt> since that has undefined behavior for forward iterators.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In Toronto Saturday afternoon LWG discussed LWG <a href="2976">2976</a> which finishes the job of removing allocator 
support from <tt>packaged_task</tt>. LWG confirmed that, despite the removal of <tt>packaged_task</tt> allocators 
"because it looks like <tt>std::function</tt>" was incorrect, they wanted to keep the allocator removals anyway, 
in large part due to this resolution being a response to an NB comment.
<p/>
If we don't want the type erased allocator situation at all, then we should remove them from the remaining place 
they exist in <tt>&lt;future&gt;</tt>, namely, in <tt>promise</tt>.
<p/>
This change also resolves potential implementation divergence on whether <tt>allocator::construct</tt> is intended 
to be used on elements constructed in the shared state, and allows the emplace-construction-in-<tt>future</tt> paper, 
<a href="http://wg21.link/p0319">P0319</a>, to be implemented without potential problems there.
</p>

<p><i>[28-Nov-2017 Mailing list discussion - set priority to P2]</i></p>

<p>Lots of people on the ML feel strongly about this; the suggestion was made that a paper would be welcomed laying out the rationale for removing allocator support here (and in other places).</p>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Consider the following constructor from 29.8.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/stringbuf.cons">[stringbuf.cons]</a> before p3:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
explicit basic_stringbuf(
  const basic_string&lt;charT, traits, Allocator&gt;&amp; s,
  ios_base::openmode which = ios_base::in | ios_base::out);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In [stringbuf.cons]/3, it says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Effects:</i> Constructs an object of class <tt>basic_stringbuf</tt>, initializing the base class with 
<tt>basic_streambuf()</tt> (30.6.3.1), and initializing <tt>mode</tt> with <tt>which</tt>. Then calls <tt>str(s)</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But that doesn't mention where the allocator for the <tt>basic_stringbuf</tt> comes from.
Until recently, most implementations just default constructed the allocator.
But that requires that the allocator be default constructible.
<p/>
<a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33727">This bug</a> was filed against libc++ for this case.
<p/>
I think that the <tt>basic_stringbuf</tt> should be constructed with a copy of the allocator from the string.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The C standard says that the expression in an <tt>assert</tt> must have a scalar type, and implies (or at least allows) 
that the condition is tested by comparison to zero. C++ says that the expression is a constant subexpression if it can 
be contextually converted to <tt>bool</tt>. Those ways to test the condition are not equivalent.
<p/>
It's possible to have expressions that meet the C++ requirements for a constant subexpression, but fail to meet the C 
requirements, and so don't compile.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

// A toy implementation of assert:
#define assert(E) (void)(((E) != 0) || (abort(), 0))

struct X {
  constexpr explicit operator bool() const { return true; }
};

constexpr bool f(const X&amp; x) {
  assert(x);
  return true;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
C++ says that <tt>assert(x)</tt> is a constant subexpression, but as it doesn't have scalar type it's not even a valid expression.
<p/>
I think either 19.3.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/cassert.syn">[cassert.syn]</a> or 19.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/assertions.assert">[assertions.assert]</a> should repeat the requirement from C that 
<em>E</em> has scalar type, either normatively or in a note. We should also consider whether "contextually converted to <tt>bool</tt>" 
is the right condition, or if we should use comparison to zero instead.

<p>
<tt>shared_ptr</tt> has been designed to support use cases where it owns a pointer to function, and whose deleter 
does something with it. This can be used, for example, to keep a dynamic library loaded for as long as their exported 
functions are referenced.
<p/>
Implementations have overlooked that the <tt>T</tt> in <tt>shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</tt> can be a function type. It isn't 
immediately obvious from the standard, and it's not possible to tell from the wording that this is intentional.

<h3><a name="3019" href="3019">3019.</a> Presentation of "program defined classes derived from <tt>error_category</tt>" [syserr.errcat.derived] unclear and contains mistakes</h3>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The presentation of section [syserr.errcat.derived] is currently somewhat problematic:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
It is not clear why this section exists and what it is specifying. Presumably, it is the subject of the phrase 
"in this subclause" of the sibling section [syserr.errcat.overview], but that's confusing (because this would require the 
interpretation of "this subclause" as the containing superclause). It would be an improvement to say "shall behave 
as specified in [syserr.errcat.derived]" in the introduction.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The current wording of [syserr.errcat.derived] requires that derived classes keep the <tt>name</tt> member function pure-virtual, 
making it impossible to have non-abstract derived classes. This appears to be an editorial error. Surely <tt>name</tt> should 
just not be required to be pure-virtual.
</p></li>
<li><p>
There seems to be no requirement concerning the <tt>message</tt> virtual member function.
</p></li>
<li><p>
We should use <tt>override</tt> rather than <tt>virtual</tt>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
I would welcome a short, introductory paragraph in [syserr.errcat.derived] that states (non-redundantly) that the following 
are requirements on users' derived classes.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Partial wording proposal:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In 19.5.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/syserr.errcat.overview">[syserr.errcat.overview]</a> p1, change:</p>

The post-condition buffer sequence requirements mandate pointer equivalence. This means that a copies of buffer sequences must 
point to the same pieces of underlying memory. While this is appropriate for <tt>MutableBufferSequence</tt>, it is unnecessary 
for <tt>ConstBufferSequence</tt> and can actually prevent useful implementation strategies such as the following constant buffer 
sequence which avoids dynamic allocations:

        char buf_[1 + 2 * sizeof(std::size_t)];

<p>
Even after the discussion on the reflector, starting with
<a href="http://lists.isocpp.org/lib-ext/2017/09/4880.php">this reflector message</a>
it's not completely clear that <i>unspecified</i> as return type
of <tt>mem_fn</tt> really means 'unspecified, but always the same'.
The same problem exists for <tt>bind()</tt> and <tt>not_fn()</tt>.
<p/>
Possible solution:
<p/>
Specify in 20.14.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/func.def">[func.def]</a> or 20.14.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/func.require">[func.require]</a> that a call wrapper type
is always the same for forwarding call wrappers if the object is returned by a function with 
the same parameter types.
And also put into 99 [func.not_fn] that a <tt>call_wrapper</tt> object is a
simple call wrapper.

<p><i>[2017-11-10, Tomasz comments and provides wording together with STL]</i></p>

<p>
From the core language rules it is already required that same function
template specialization have the same return type. Given that the
invocation of <tt>mem_fn</tt>/<tt>bind</tt>/<tt>not_fn</tt> will always return 
the same wrapper type, if they are instantiated (called with) same parameters type.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The spec for <tt>&lt;algorithms&gt;</tt> <tt>pop_heap</tt> includes
</p>
<blockquote><p>
-1- <i>Requires:</i> The range <tt>[first, last)</tt> shall be a valid non-empty heap.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This has the unfortunate consequence that to pop a value and push a new value is substantially less efficient than necessary. 
The popped value must be extracted by <tt>pop_heap</tt> (using up to 2 log <tt><i>N</i></tt> compares and swaps), and then, in 
<tt>push_heap</tt>, the new value must be inserted (for up to <tt><i>N</i></tt> compares and swaps, but more usually something 
like log <tt><i>N</i></tt>).
<p/>
Simply relaxing the requirement to
</p>
<blockquote><p>
-1- <i>Requires:</i> The range <tt>[first, last - 1)</tt> shall be a valid heap.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
enables use of <tt>pop_heap</tt> in an integrated push-and-pop operation, with less than half the number of expected compare 
and swap operations. Furthermore, if, as is often the case, the newly pushed value would have ended up at position <tt>first</tt>, 
the push/pop operation could complete in time <tt>&#x1d4aa;(1)</tt>, instead of (3 log <tt><i>N</i></tt>).
<p/>
The effect of the proposed relaxation on existing library implementations would be minimal in the extreme, and on existing user 
code nil. The base algorithm code remains exactly identical. The only changes needed would be to any instrumentation in a 
debugging version of the library, which would just need to relax its check, and to test suites that should exercise the newly 
tolerated input.
<p/>
Users today are tempted to get the improved performance by relying on existing implementations' tacit tolerance of input that 
only satisfies the proposed, relaxed requirements. In fact, the 
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/pop_heap">cppreference.com page on <tt>pop_heap</tt></a> offers no hint 
that this usage is not already allowed. This change would bless such reliance as formally permitted.
<p/>
After this change, minor extensions to <tt>std::priority_queue</tt> would enable it to take advantage of the newly efficient operation, 
perhaps:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void pop_push(const Type&amp;);
void pop_push(Type&amp;&amp;);
template &lt;class... Args&gt; void pop_emplace(Args&amp;&amp;... args);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
These will appear in a formal proposal if the resolution is accepted.

In discussion of D0202R3 in Albuquerque, it was observed that <tt>pop_heap</tt> and <tt>sort_heap</tt> had 
<tt>constexpr</tt> removed for their requirement of <tt>ValueSwappable</tt>. It was then observed that 
<tt>push_heap</tt> and <tt>make_heap</tt> were not similarly marked as having the <tt>ValueSwappable</tt> requirement. 
The room believed this was likely a specification error, and asked to open an issue to track it.

<h3><a name="3044" href="3044">3044.</a> Strange specification of <tt>max_size()</tt> for an allocator</h3>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Table 31 in the C++17 standard specifies <tt>X::max_size()</tt> (where <tt>X</tt> is an allocator type) as "The largest value 
that can meaningfully be passed to <tt>X::allocate()</tt>". Noticeably missing is the statement "<i>Throws:</i> Nothing".
<p/>
As an example of why this is an issue, note that <tt>vector::max_size()</tt> and <tt>allocator_traits::max_size()</tt> are 
both marked <tt>noexcept</tt>. We must then interpret <tt>max_size()</tt> as being allowed to sometimes call 
<tt>std::terminate</tt>, or else <tt>{vector, allocator_traits, ...}::max_size()</tt> must be allowed to directly calculate 
<tt>numeric_limits&lt;size_type&gt;::max() / sizeof(value_type)</tt> instead of querying the allocator, even if 
<tt>Alloc::max_size()</tt> exists. This seems like a bug in the wording for the requirements of <tt>max_size()</tt> in an 
allocator type. I think an issue should be opened on this subject to add <i>Throws:</i> Nothing or similar to the requirements 
of <tt>max_size()</tt> for an allocator.
<p/>
As an example consider writing up a framework to test the exception-safety of types in a given framework, since they were all 
written in an exception-free environment. One of the types in the framework is an allocator which, in a controlled way, 
can throw an exception at any point where it is allowed by the standard. It's important that the test framework be as pedantic 
as possible, so the allocator type throws on <tt>max_size()</tt>, since it is currently allowed to by the standard. When a 
reasonable <tt>vector</tt> implementation (at least those in libstdc++ and msvc) is, for example, asked to construct a 
<tt>vector</tt> from an <tt>initializer_list</tt>, it will call <tt>allocator_traits&lt;Alloc&gt;::max_size()</tt>, which will 
terminate the program because the exception thrown in <tt>Alloc::max_size()</tt> propagated through the <tt>noexcept</tt> 
traits function. Although this is conformant behavior, I think it's a bug in the standard that a function as benign as 
<tt>max_size()</tt> can terminate the program in this manner, and I think the fix is that a conformant allocator should be 
required to supply a non-throwing <tt>max_size()</tt> member function.
<p/>
Daniel:
<p/>
This problem was shortly discussed during review of LWG <a href="2162">2162</a> (see comment 2012-08-05). At that time
the more drastic but also more consistent requirement that an allocator's <tt>max_size</tt> function shall not throw
exceptions has not been added. IMO this position should be reconsidered to follow the spirit of the new issue LWG 
<a href="3044">3044</a>.

<p><i>[2018-01; Priority set to 3 after mailing list discussion]</i></p>


<p><i>[2018-08-21, Jonathan comments and provides wording]</i></p>

<p>
The phrase "the largest value that can meaningfully be passed to <tt>X::allocate()</tt>" is meaningless. Is it a 
requirement on the caller, so that larger values must not be passed? Or a hint from the allocator implementor that larger 
values will produce a <tt>bad_alloc exception</tt>? Can the return value change dynamically, based on the free memory 
available to the allocator?! &mdash; LWG <a href="197">197</a> says it can't change.
<p/>
As noted in the LWG <a href="2162">2162</a> comments, we don't currently guarantee it can be called on a <tt>const</tt> object 
(so <tt>allocator_traits</tt> will not use the allocator's <tt>max_size()</tt> if it's non-<tt>const</tt>, although that was 
unclear before DR <a href="2284">2284</a>). In addition to adding "<i>Throws:</i> nothing" we should ensure it's callable 
on <tt>const</tt> lvalues, and clarify what "meaningfully" means and who is supposed to care about it. My proposed 
resolution doesn't achieve all of this, but is a start.

<p>
[refwrap] says that <tt>reference_wrapper&lt;T&gt;</tt> is a "wrapper around a reference to an object or function of type <tt>T</tt>" 
but this doesn't actually constrain it, and doesn't forbid non-referenceable function types like <tt>int() const</tt>.
<p/>
There is no way to construct a <tt>reference_wrapper&lt;int() const&gt;</tt> but implementations are required to provide partial 
specializations for functions with <i>cv</i>-qualifiers and ref-qualifiers in order to define a nested <tt>result_type</tt>. 
It should be undefined to instantiate <tt>reference_wrapper&lt;T&gt;</tt> with a non-referenceable type, or with a reference type 
(since references to references are not possible). Making it undefined (rather than ill-formed or unspecified) means implementations 
are not required to diagnose such invalid specializations, but also don't have to go to the effort of supporting weak result types etc.

</blockquote>

<p><i>[2019-03-15; Daniel comments and provides revised wording]</i></p>

<p>
The current wording is now far behind the working draft and a synchronization is therefore recommended. In particular, with the
acceptance of <a href="http://wg21.link/p0357r1">P0357R1</a>, the specification of <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> has no longer any
<i>weak result type</i>. Second, I would like to concur with a <a href="http://lists.isocpp.org/lib/2017/12/5023.php">remark 
from Tomasz</a> to change the wording to replace the undefined behavior by an ill-formed program instead, because <em>every</em>
attempt to instantiate the definition of <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> will instantiate its member declarations, and this would
cause the program to become ill-formed anyway because of the illegal formation of references to non-referenceable function 
types for member functions such as <tt>T&amp; get() const noexcept</tt>.
<p/>
As concrete wording suggestion I would recommend wording that ensures that an ill-formed program is only required when a
specialization of <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> is instantiated, because in the absence of a constrained template parameter
we shouldn't require implementations to diagnose even forming the name of a <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> specialization such 
as in the following example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
using X = reference_wrapper&lt;int() const&gt;;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The wording below does not take advantage of a <i>Mandates:</i> element to prevent a dependency on LWG <a href="3193">3193</a>
and because such an element is rarely used to specify class templates. If the committee wishes to use such an element, 
the equivalent wording would be:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Mandates:</i> <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> is instantiated with a referenceable type (16.3.22 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/defns.referenceable">[defns.referenceable]</a>)

Given <tt>atomic&lt;int&gt; meow{INT_MAX};</tt>, <tt>meow.fetch_add(1)</tt> has well-defined behavior because 31.7.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.types.int">[atomics.types.int]</a> p7 says that
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Remarks:</i> For signed integer types, arithmetic is defined to use two's complement representation. There are no undefined results.
</p>

but <tt>meow += 1</tt> and <tt>++meow</tt> have undefined behavior, because these operator functions are defined (by, respectively, 
31.7.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.types.int">[atomics.types.int]</a> p8 and 31.7.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.types.memop">[atomics.types.memop]</a>) to be equivalent to <tt>return fetch_add(1) + 1;</tt>, 
and so the addition of 1 to the result of <tt>fetch_add</tt> &mdash; which causes an integer overflow in this case &mdash; occurs 
outside the protection of <tt>fetch_add</tt> magic. Additionally, the return value might differ from what <tt>fetch_add</tt> actually
wrote since that addition isn't required to use two's complement. This seems like a trap for the unwary. Is it intended?
<p/>
A similar issue affects the <tt>atomic&lt;T*&gt;</tt> partial specialization for pointers.

<h3><a name="3049" href="3049">3049.</a> Missing wording allowing algorithms to use copies of function objects as substitutes for their parameters</h3>
<p><b>Section:</b> 25.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/algorithms.requirements">[algorithms.requirements]</a> <b>Status:</b> <a href="lwg-active.html#Open">Open</a>

</p>
<p><b>View all issues with</b> <a href="lwg-status.html#Open">Open</a> status.</p>
<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
When designing the parallel algorithms library, we intended for parallel algorithms to copy their function objects parameters 
when it is possible and useful to do so, but there doesn't appear to be any wording to enable that latitude. To the contrary, 
algorithm specifications refer to their function object parameters by name, implying that a copy of the parameter may not 
be used as a substitute.
<p/>
This was noticed when Billy O'Neal observed that parallel <tt>generate()</tt> did not share parallel <tt>for_each()</tt> and 
<tt>for_each_n()</tt>'s special requirement for a <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> user-provided function object.
<p/>
This <tt>CopyConstructible Function</tt> requirement was added to relax legacy <tt>for_each()</tt>'s <tt>MoveConstructible Function</tt>
requirement to allow parallel implementations to make copies as necessary. All parallel algorithms need similar permissions, 
but a strong requirement for <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> in all algorithms is too restrictive.
<p/>
What we require is to allow algorithm implementations to use copies of function objects as substitutes for their original parameters, 
while not requiring that all function object parameters be copyable.
<p/>
Casey Carter noted that 25.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/algorithms.requirements">[algorithms.requirements]</a> p8 grants permission to all algorithms to copy their function 
object parameters. However, this paragraph is not normative and does not indicate how the algorithm is allowed to use such copies. 
Additionally, it does not specify which algorithm parameters are the ones called out as function objects. For example, 
25.6.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/alg.generate">[alg.generate]</a> refers to <tt>gen</tt> as a function object, but 25.5.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/alg.foreach">[alg.foreach]</a> does not refer to <tt>f</tt> 
as a function object. All the other types of callable algorithm parameters (i.e. <tt>Predicate</tt>, <tt>BinaryPredicate</tt>, 
<tt>Compare</tt>, <tt>UnaryOperation</tt>, <tt>BinaryOperation</tt>, <tt>BinaryOperation1</tt>, and <tt>BinaryOperation2</tt>) 
are defined to be function objects in 25.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/algorithms.requirements">[algorithms.requirements]</a> and 25.3.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/algorithms.parallel.user">[algorithms.parallel.user]</a>. This 
list intentionally omits <tt>Function</tt> and <tt>Generator</tt> by design.
<p/>
A potential resolution would introduce normative wording to explicitly allow algorithms to use copies of function object parameters 
as substitutes for their function object parameters, and remove ambiguity in algorithm specifications about which parameters are 
function objects.

<p>
The converting constructor in <tt>std::chrono::duration</tt> is currently specified as
(27.5.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.duration.cons">[time.duration.cons]</a> p1):
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class Rep2&gt;
  constexpr explicit duration(const Rep2&amp; r);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Remarks:</i> This constructor shall not participate in overload resolution unless <tt>Rep2</tt> is
implicitly convertible to <tt>rep</tt> and [&hellip;]
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
But the parameter is of type <tt>Rep2 const</tt>, so we should check that <tt>Rep2 const</tt> is
implicitly convertible to <tt>rep</tt>, not just <tt>Rep2</tt>. This means that for a type like:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
struct X { operator int64_t() /* not const */; };
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<tt>std::is_constructible_v&lt;std::chrono::seconds, X&gt;</tt> is <tt>true</tt>, but actual
construction will fail to compile.
<p/>
Further analysis of sub-clause 27.5 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.duration">[time.duration]</a> revealed similar specification problems in
some other functions.

<tt>std::visit</tt> accepts a parameter pack of forwarding references named
<tt>vars</tt> whose types are the parameter pack <tt>Variants</tt>. Despite that:
<ol>
<li>the names of both packs are variants of "variant",</li>
<li>para 1 passes the types in <tt>Variants</tt> (modified) to <tt>variant_size_v</tt>,</li>
<li>para 3 uses the expression <tt>vars<sub><i>i</i></sub>.index()</tt>,</li>

and</li>
<li>para 5 mentions "..the number of alternative types of <tt>Variants<sub>0</sub></tt>"</li>
</ol>
the <i>Requires</i> element imposes no explicit requirements on the types in <tt>Variants</tt>.
Notably, the <tt>Variants</tt> are not required to be <tt>variant</tt>s. This lack of constraints

(The resolution of #3 resolves part of <a href="http://wg21.link/p0488r0#page=10">C++17 NB comment US 36</a>.) 
<p/>
The handling of several options for <tt>filesystem::copy()</tt> is wrong:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Single-level directory copying is silently suppressed by any flag other than 
<tt>copy_options::recursive</tt> (even <tt>copy_options::directories_only</tt>). Single-level 
directory copying operates via using some unspecified flag to trigger this misfeature.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>copy_options::create_symlinks</tt> and <tt>copy_options::skip_symlinks</tt> affect 
the interpretation of the destination name; the latter shouldn't ever, and the former should 
affect only broken symlinks (since it would want to replace them).</p></li>
<li><p>The <tt>copy_options</tt> groups for existing target files and the form of copying are 
consulted only for creating regular files.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>copy("file", "dir")</tt> creates dir/file, but <tt>copy("symlink", "dir", 
copy_options::copy_symlinks)</tt> fails.</p></li>
<li><p>If a symlink is encountered with <tt>copy_options::copy_symlinks</tt> and 
<tt>copy_options::create_symlinks</tt>, the latter flag is ignored (but its otherwise sensible 
restriction to absolute paths applies) rather than the former.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>copy_options::create_symlinks</tt> without <tt>copy_options::copy_symlinks</tt> 
fails if it encounters a symlink. (This is particularly damaging for recursive operation.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
This issue, since it replaces so much text, also addresses two error-handling concerns in passing:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The significance of <tt>equivalent(from, to)</tt> failing is unspecified. (Ignoring such 
failures entirely would make dangerous those operations that replace the target with a link.)</p></li>
<li><p>Copying a directory involves several operations. When an <tt>error_code</tt> is being used, 
the process continues past errors and (because successful functions call <tt>ec.clear()</tt>) 
may suppress them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
This expands on the resolution for LWG <a href="2681">2681</a>.
<p/>
This also addresses the same issue as LWG <a href="2682">2682</a>, but has a different result 
(based on the fact that the Example successfully copies directories to new, non-existent names).

<p>Need to gather implementation experience; revisit in Kona. Status to Open.</p>

<p><i>[2018-11-13; Billy O'Neal comments]</i></p>

<p>
I (Billy O'Neal) prefer Davis' solution to LWG 3057, as I think the wording follows the meaning of the individual 
enum values more closely, and enables more scenarios to function correctly instead of reporting such cases as errors.
<p/>
However, I don't want to adopt that wording as is because it requires my implementation to detect errors in places 
that force us to do a bunch of extra system calls, and I don't believe those specific ways error handling happens 
is relevant to what the copy API wants to do.
<p/>
Ideally, the wording would be structured such that it said "here's a list of error conditions, if they happen we 
aren't going to tell you when exactly they are detected" and then listed the behavior irrespective of when errors 
happen. That way implementations can do the error checks when it makes sense according to what their system APIs 
report. For example, anything that requires symlink resolution is very expensive on my platform so I'd want to 
be able to defer anything related to status (rather than <tt>symlink_status</tt>) to after I've detected that 
there's actually a symlink (or junction) involved.

<h3><a name="3059" href="3059">3059.</a> Wrong requirements for map-like associative container assignment?</h3>

<p>
What are the requirements for
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
a = b;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
... where <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are of map-like associative container type (<tt>map</tt>, 
<tt>multimap</tt>, <tt>unordered_map</tt>, <tt>unordered_multimap</tt>)?
<p/>
The general container requirements say just:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
r = a  <i>// Postconditions: r == a</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
(Incidentally, earlier in the table, there is a clear error: the general container requirements permit 
"<tt>a = rv</tt>" for assignment from an rvalue, but "<tt>a</tt>" here is a potentially-const container. 
Oops.) Oddly. there are no requirements at all on <tt>T</tt> here.
<p/>
The allocator-aware container requirements add:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
a = t  <i>// Requires: T is CopyInsertable into X and CopyAssignable.</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
... where <tt>T</tt> is the container's <tt>value_type</tt>, that is, <tt>pair&lt;const key_type, 
mapped_type&gt;</tt>. Note that such a pair is not <tt>CopyAssignable</tt> for "normal" key types 
that disallow assignment to <tt>const</tt> objects. They also add:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
a = rv  <i>// Requires: if !POCMA, T is MoveInsertable into X and MoveAssignable.</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
... which has the same problem in the !POCMA case.
<p/>
The associative container requirements and unordered associative container requirements have a similar problem for assignment from an initializer list:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
a = il  <i>// Requires: value_type is CopyInsertable into X and CopyAssignable.</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Presumably these assignments are intended to actually work, but what are the intended constraints? 
Do we wish to allow implementations to perform node reuse for these map-like containers? 
Presumably yes, and if so, the <tt>key_type</tt> portion of the node must be assigned as well as the 
<tt>value_type</tt> portion (for instance, with whatever implementation technique is used to power 
<tt>node_handle</tt>) as we cannot assume that key equivalence (or, for <tt>unordered_*map</tt>, 
even key equality) implies substitutability.
<p/>
I think, then, that the associative container requirements and unordered associative container requirements should specify different requirements for the "<tt>a = t</tt>", "<tt>a = rv</tt>", and "<tt>a = il</tt>" for the map-like containers; specifically:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>for "<tt>a = t</tt>" and "<tt>a = il</tt>", we should require that <tt>value_type</tt> is 
<tt>CopyInsertable</tt> into <tt>X</tt>, and <tt>key_type</tt> and <tt>mapped_type</tt> are 
<tt>CopyAssignable</tt></p></li>
<li><p>for "<tt>a = rv</tt>", if !POCMA, we should require that <tt>value_type</tt> is 
<tt>MoveInsertable</tt> into <tt>X</tt> and <tt>key_type</tt> and <tt>mapped_type</tt> are 
<tt>MoveAssignable</tt></p></li>
</ul>
<p>
(And we should fix the general container requirements to constrain "<tt>r = rv</tt>", not "<tt>a = rv</tt>".)
<p/>
<b>Daniel:</b>
<p/>
The "<tt>a = rv</tt>" problematic is already handled by LWG <a href="3028">3028</a>.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
All of the scan algorithms ([exclusive.scan], [inclusive.scan], [transform.exclusive.scan], [transform.inclusive.scan]) have language like "If <tt>init</tt> is provided, <tt>T</tt> shall be 
<tt>MoveConstructible</tt> (Table 23); otherwise, <tt>ForwardIterator1</tt>'s value type shall be
<tt>MoveConstructible</tt>.". However, the algorithms operational semantics require that that type 
be written "by copy" to the destination range, making support for move only types impossible.
<p/>
We probably need to examine real implementations of these things and see what requirements are actually 
necessary, as in general <tt><i>GENERALIZED_SUM</i></tt> and <tt><i>GENERALIZED_NONCOMMUTATIVE_SUM</i></tt> 
need to specify the type used to store intermediate calculations.

<p>
So, it returns <tt>strong_ordering::...</tt> or <tt>strong_equality::</tt> or <tt>a &lt;=&gt; b</tt>. 
By the normal core deduction rules, that means it's always ill-formed, because one return type 
deduction deduces <tt>strong_ordering</tt> and another deduces <tt>strong_equality</tt>.
<p/>
I'm guessing the idea was actually that the above happens as if by four separate overloads / 
<tt>constexpr if</tt> / else. But I think you need to actually say that.

<p>
The parallel forms of the uninitialized memory algorithms in <tt>&lt;memory&gt;</tt> are
underspecified in two ways. First, they missed the change that all parallel
algorithms require at least Forward Iterators, even for input ranges. See
<a href="http://wg21.link/p0467r2">P0467R2</a> for more details.
<p/>
The second problem is that they do not have a separate specification to
the serial forms. This is a problem in two ways. First, there is no more
blanket wording saying a parallel policy algorithm has the same semantics
as the serial form unless otherwise specified, so in principle these algorithms
are totally unspecified. However, assuming that intent, all of the existing
specifications use an as-if formulation with code that is explicitly serial in
nature, so need a new specification that talks about the effects on each
element without including the iteration order.

<p>
A typical specification of the algorithms for initializing raw memory in <tt>&lt;memory&gt;</tt> looks like:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects:</i> Equivalent to:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
for (; first != last; ++first)
  ::new (static_cast&lt;void*&gt;(addressof(*first)))
    typename iterator_traits&lt;ForwardIterator&gt;::value_type;
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, this hides a nasty question:
<p/>
How do we bind a reference to an uninitialized object when dereferencing our iterator,
so that <tt>static_cast&lt;void*&gt;(addressor(*first))</tt> does not trigger undefined behavior on
the call to <tt>*first</tt>?
<p/>
When pointers are the only iterators we cared about, we could simply cast the iterator
value to <tt>void*</tt> without dereferencing. I don't see how to implement this spec safely
without introducing another customization point for iterators that performs the same
function as casting a pointer to <tt>void*</tt> in order to get the address of the element.

26.8.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/sf.cmath">[sf.cmath]</a>/1 uses the phrase "report a domain error" (emphasis mine):
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
If any argument value to any of the functions specified in this subclause is a NaN (Not a Number), the
function shall return a NaN but it shall not <b>report a domain error</b>. Otherwise, the function shall 
<b>report a domain error</b> for just those argument values for which:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the function description's <i>Returns:</i> clause explicitly specifies a domain and those argument 
values fall outside the specified domain, or</p></li>
<li><p>the corresponding mathematical function value has a nonzero imaginary component, or</p></li>
<li><p>the corresponding mathematical function is not mathematically defined.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
The behavior this phrase is attempting to convey is unclear. A quick search through the text of the 
standard for "domain error" finds only the <tt>domain_error</tt> exception type defined in 
19.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/domain.error">[domain.error]</a>. Is the intent of "report a domain error" that the special math functions 
throw an exception of type <tt>domain_error</tt>, or is it that they behave as specified in C11 
7.12.1 "Treatment of error conditions" para 2 which defines the term "domain error"?

the filename elements from <tt>*this</tt> are themselves acceptable <i>root-name</i>s, <tt>operator/=</tt>

<p>
On a POSIX implementation, this would return <tt>path("../b:")</tt>, but on a Windows implementation, the

<b>Addresses: networking.ts</b>
<p>The <tt>DynamicBuffer</tt> overloads of <code>async_read</code> and <code>async_write</code>, and 
<code>async_read_until</code>, are underspecified with respect to the lifetime of the dynamic 
buffer argument <code>b</code>.</p>

<p>Asio's implementation (and the intended specification) performs <code><em>DECAY_COPY</em>(b)</code> 
in the <code>async_read</code>, <code>async_write</code>, and <code>async_read_until</code> 
initiating functions. All operations performed on <code>b</code> are actually performed on that 
decay-copy, or on a move-constructed descendant of it. The copy is intended to refer to the same 
underlying storage and be otherwise interchangeable with the original in every way.</p>

<p>Most initiating functions' argument lifetimes are covered by [async.reqmts.async.lifetime]. As 
an rvalue reference it falls under the second bullet, which specifies that the object is copied 
(but doesn't say decay-copied).</p>

<p>The proposed resolution adds a postcondition for <tt>DynamicBuffer</tt> move construction, and 
specifies that <code><em>DECAY_COPY</em>(b)</code> be used for each of these functions. The following 
two alternative resolutions may also be considered:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add an extra bullet to [async.reqmts.async.lifetime] to cover rvalue parameters (but specifically exclude CompletionTokens).</p></li>
<li><p>Change the <tt>DynamicBuffer</tt> arguments to be by-value. (And also change the corresponding synchronous operations to be consistent.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>However, the proposed resolution below is presented as a change that minimizes the scope of the impact.</p>

<p>Suppose that we have a user-defined class <code>dyn_buf</code> that satisfies the DynamicBuffer 
requirements ([buffer.reqmts.dynamicbuffer]), and is additionally copy-constructible. The following snippet compiles, as expected:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
dyn_buf b;

</pre></blockquote>
<p>However, this next snippet will not compile, when it should:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
dyn_buf b;
net::read(my_socket, b);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This is due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>DynamicBuffer</code> template parameter being deduced as <code>dyn_buf&amp;</code>, and</li>
<li>the <code>read</code> overload being specified to not participate in overload resolution unless <code>is_dynamic_buffer_v&lt;DynamicBuffer&gt;</code> is <code>true</code>.</li>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
<tt>strtod()</tt> distinguishes between overflow and underflow by returning a value that is either 
very large or very small. Floating point <tt>from_chars</tt> does not currently offer any way for 
callers to distinguish these two cases.
<p/>
It would be beneficial if users could migrate from <tt>strtod()</tt> to <tt>from_chars</tt> without 
loss of functionality.
<p/>
I recommend that floating point <tt>from_chars</tt> use <tt>value</tt> as an overflow-vs-underflow 
reporting channel, in the same manner as <tt>strtod()</tt>.
<p/>
My proposed wording gives <tt>from_chars</tt> the same wide latitude that <tt>strtod()</tt> enjoys 
for handling underflow. A high-quality implementation would likely set <tt>ec == result_out_of_range</tt> 
for underflow only when the nearest representable <tt>float</tt> to the parsed value is a zero and 
the parsed mantissa was nonzero. In this case <tt>value</tt> would be set to (an appropriately-signed) zero. 
It is worth considering giving <tt>from_chars</tt> this more predictable behavior, if library writers 
feel they can provide this guarantee for all platforms. (I have a proof-of-concept integer-based 
implementation for IEEE doubles with this property.)

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
It's unclear how different termination facilities in C++ interact (and how they interact with the C 
termination facilities). Individually some of these functions try to handle corner cases, but hilarity 
ensues when combined with each other. As a simple example, can an <tt>atexit</tt> handler call <tt>exit</tt>? 
If not, can it call <tt>quick_exit</tt>, and can then <tt>at_quick_exit</tt> handler call <tt>exit</tt>? 
Is it possible to install an <tt>atexit</tt> handler from an <tt>at_quick_exit</tt>, without strongly 
happens before, while handling a separate <tt>atexit</tt> handler (and what happens then)?
<p/>
The termination handlers and termination conditions I collected:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>returning from <tt>main</tt> calls <tt>atexit</tt> handlers.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>atexit</tt> / <tt>exit</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>at_quick_exit</tt> / <tt>quick_exit</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>set_terminate</tt></p></li>
<li><p>violating <tt>noexcept</tt> and other things that call <tt>std::terminate</tt> (see 
<tt>[except.terminate]</tt>)</p></li>
<li><p>violating exception specification</p></li>
<li><p>parallel algorithms leaving with uncaught exception</p></li>
<li><p>some <tt>std::signal</tt> such as <tt>SIGTERM</tt>, <tt>SIGSEGV</tt>, <tt>SIGINT</tt>, 
<tt>SIGILL</tt>, <tt>SIGABRT</tt>, and (maybe?) <tt>SIGFPE</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>set_unexpected</tt> (now a zombie)</p></li>
<li><p><tt>unexpected_handler</tt> (now a zombie)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
What's unclear is:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is termination handling a DAG?</p></li>
<li><p>Which thread(s) are termination handlers called on?</p></li>
<li><p>Is program termination Turing complete?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
I've written a sample program which exercises some of this, see 
<a href="https://github.com/jfbastien/terminator/blob/master/terminator.cc">here</a>.
</p>

<p><i>[2018-04-02, Jens comments]</i></p>

<p>
Any potential wording should carefully take [basic.start] into account, and maybe should actually be integrated 
into the core wording, not the library wording.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Table 54, Character traits requirements, says that <tt>char_traits::move</tt> allows the ranges to overlap, 
but <tt>char_traits::copy</tt> requires that <tt>p</tt> is not in the range <tt>[s, s + n)</tt>. This 
appears to be an attempt to map to the requirements of <tt>memmove</tt> and <tt>memcpy</tt> respectively,
allowing those to be used to implement the functions, however the requirements for <tt>copy</tt> are 
weaker than those for <tt>memcpy</tt>. The C standard says for <tt>memcpy</tt> "If copying takes place 
between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined" which is a stronger requirement than the start 
of the source range not being in the destination range.
<p/>
All of libstdc++, libc++ and VC++ simply use <tt>memcpy</tt> for <tt>char_traits&lt;char&gt;::copy</tt>, 
resulting in undefined behaviour in this example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
char p[] = "abc";
char* s = p + 1;
std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;::copy(s, p, 2);
assert(std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;::compare(p, "aab", 3) == 0);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If the intention is to allow <tt>memcpy</tt> as a valid implementation then the precondition is 
wrong (unfortunately nobody realized this when fixing <tt>char_traits::move</tt> in LWG DR <a href="7">7</a>). 
If the intention is to require <tt>memmove</tt> then it is strange to have separate <tt>copy</tt> and 
<tt>move</tt> functions that both use <tt>memmove</tt>.
<p/>
N.B. <tt>std::copy</tt> and <tt>std::copy_backward</tt> are not valid implementations of 
<tt>char_traits::copy</tt> either, due to different preconditions.
<p/>
Changing the precondition implicitly applies to <tt>basic_string::copy</tt> (21.3.2.6.7 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/string.copy">[string.copy]</a>), 
and <tt>basic_string_view::copy</tt> (21.4.2.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/string.view.ops">[string.view.ops]</a>), which are currently required 
to support partially overlapping ranges:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::string s = "abc";
s.copy(s.data() + 1, s.length() - 1);
assert(s == "aab");

In general requirements on a whole program, as opposed to a single translation unit, generally specify 
"no diagnostic required", since we don't want to require implementations to do multi-translation-unit 
analysis. However, 17.6.2.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/new.delete.single">[new.delete.single]</a> paragraph 11 says,
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If a function with a <tt>size</tt> parameter is defined, the program shall also define the corresponding 
version without the <tt>size</tt> parameter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is clearly not restricted to a single translation unit; should "no diagnostic required" be added?

Presumably the <tt>forward_list</tt> proposal predated the adoption of LWG 300's PR and was never updated

<p>
All the copy algorithms have some kind of prohibition on having the input and output ranges overlap. 
<p/>
The serial version of <tt>copy</tt> says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires:</i> <tt>result</tt> shall not be in the range <tt>[first, last)</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The parallel version of <tt>copy</tt> says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires:</i> The ranges <tt>[first, last)</tt> and <tt>[result, result + (last - first))</tt> 
shall not overlap.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
<tt>copy_if</tt> says:

</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires:</i> <tt>result</tt> shall not be in the range <tt>[first, last)</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But <tt>copy_n</tt> has no such requirement.
<p/>
I think it should. I checked the minutes of the LWG discussion from 2008 when this was added, and 
there was no discussion of overlapping ranges.
</p>

<p>What formulation do we want here? Is it sufficient to say "... shall not be in the range ..." or should we use the stronger "... shall not overlap ..."? Some <tt>copy</tt> variants use one, some use the other.  Should we be consistent? Issue <a href="3085">3085</a> is a similar issue for <tt>char_traits::copy</tt>.</p>

27.5.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/time.duration.cons">[time.duration.cons]</a> p4 says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>

<p>

</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
with this example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
duration&lt;int, milli&gt; ms(3);
duration&lt;int, micro&gt; us = ms;  <i>// OK</i>
duration&lt;int, milli&gt; ms2 = us; <i>// error</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
It's unclear to me what "no overflow is induced in the conversion" means in the above. What happens here:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
duration&lt;int, milli&gt; ms(INT_MAX);
duration&lt;int, micro&gt; us = ms;  <i>// ???</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
An overflow is clearly induced in the conversion here: internally, we'll multiply <tt>INT_MAX</tt> by 1000. But that 
cannot be determined statically (in general), and so can't affect the result of overload resolution.
<p/>
So what's actually supposed to happen? Are we actually just supposed to check that <tt>Rep2</tt> is no larger than <tt>Rep</tt>? 
(If so, what happens on overflow? Undefined behavior?)
<p/>
It has been pointed out by Howard Hinnant:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
This refers to the compile-time conversion factor to convert <tt>Period2</tt> to <tt>Period</tt>. If that conversion factor 
is not representable as a (reduced) <tt>ratio&lt;N, D&gt;</tt>, then the constructor is SFINAE'd out. This might happen 
(for example) converting years to picoseconds.
</blockquote>
<p>
I would not have guessed that from the wording. Maybe replacing "no overflow is induced in the conversion" with "the result 
of <tt>ratio_divide&lt;Period2, Period&gt;</tt> is representable as a <tt>ratio</tt>" or similar would help?

What should happen here:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
const int bpm = 100;
using beats = duration&lt;int, ratio&lt;60, 100&gt;&gt;;
auto v = time_of_day&lt;beats&gt;(beats{2}).subseconds();
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
? 2 beats at 100bpm is <tt>1.2</tt> seconds. The <tt>time_of_day</tt> constructor specification says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<tt>seconds()</tt> returns the integral number of seconds <tt>since_midnight</tt> is after <tt>(00:00:00 + hours() + minutes())</tt>.
<tt>subseconds()</tt> returns the integral number of fractional precision seconds <tt>since_midnight</tt> is after 
<tt>(00:00:00 + hours() + minutes() + seconds())</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But that's impossible. If <tt>seconds()</tt> returns 1, we need to return a <tt>subseconds()</tt> value representing <tt>0.2s</tt> 
of type <tt>precision</tt>, but type <tt>precision</tt> can only represent multiples of <tt>0.6s</tt>.
<p/>
Should this <tt>time_of_day</tt> specialization only be available for the case where <tt>seconds</tt> is convertible to 
<tt>precision</tt>? Or should the <tt>precision</tt> type used by this specialization be 
<tt>common_type_t&lt;seconds, duration&lt;Rep, Period&gt;&gt;</tt> rather than merely <tt>duration&lt;Rep, Period&gt;</tt>?
<p/>
Either way I think we need a wording update to specify one of those two behaviors.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
[bitmask.types] specifies the semantics of a bitmask type in terms of an "exposition only" <tt>enum</tt> definition, 
together with some constants and overloads. Notably, it is depicted as an unscoped enum, which implies among other 
things that it is implicitly convertible to <tt>int_type</tt>. At least some sources treat that as normative (as 
of this writing, <a href="http://cppreference.com/">cppreference.com</a>'s documentation for 
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/BitmaskType"><tt>BitmaskType</tt></a> says the expression 
<tt>(X &amp; Y) != 0</tt> is guaranteed to be well-formed), and it's hard to argue that they're wrong on the basis 
of the existing wording.
<p/>
On the other hand, many standard library types are depicted as scoped enums, but still specified to be "bitmask types". 
As far as I can tell, it's impossible in library code to make a scoped enum implicitly convertible to its underlying type, 
and even if you could, what would be the point? Presumably the specification of those types as scoped enums is intended 
to have some sort of observable consequences.
<p/>
In addition, some library types (notably in clause 31) are specified to be bitmask types, without indicating whether 
they are scoped or unscoped. It's not clear what the standard guarantees about e.g. whether they can be implicitly 
converted.
<p/>
I assume the intent is that "bitmask type" doesn't specify an implicit conversion, or any of the other ways unscoped 
and scoped enums differ, but the standard doesn't actually say that. We really ought to rewrite [bitmask.types] as 
a requirements table, but here's a quick hack to the existing wording as a stopgap.

<p>
Paragraph citations relative to <a href="http://wg21.link/n4727">N4727</a>.
</p>
<p>
[stringbuf.virtuals]/10 says that <tt>newoff</tt> might be calculated from <tt>xnext - xbegin</tt>, 
or from <tt>high_mark - xbegin</tt>. After <tt>newoff</tt> is calculated, it does the null pointer 
check against and zero offset check. However, that means the effects may have already done 
<tt>nullptr -</tt> non-<tt>nullptr</tt>, or non-<tt>nullptr - nullptr</tt>, which [expr.add]/5 says 
is undefined behavior.
<p/>
Moreover, the attempt at avoiding this problem only tests <tt>newoff</tt>, not the value actually used 
which is <tt>newoff + off</tt>. For example, <tt>buf.seekoff(100, ios_base::beg, ios_base::out)</tt> 
on a read-only <tt>streambuf</tt> would try to assign <tt>pptr() + newoff + off to pptr()</tt>, but 
<tt>pptr()</tt> may have been <tt>nullptr</tt>, giving <tt>nullptr + 0 + 100</tt> which triggers UB. 
(Perhaps the "refers to an uninitialized character" bit protects that though).
<p/>
Last, the <i>Returns:</i> element says that it returns <tt>newoff</tt>, but then also says it returns 
the resulting stream position, which should be something like <tt>newoff + off</tt>. (I checked libc++ 
and MSVC++ and we both return <tt>newoff + off</tt>)
<p/>
We probably want to resolve that by renaming the value that comes out of Table 108 to something like

<p>
The example in [fs.path.decompose] p7 includes:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
path("//host").filename();  <i>// yields</i> ""
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This result isn't guaranteed, it depends whether the implementation interprets <tt>"//host"</tt> as a <i>root-name</i> 
or as a <i>root-directory</i> (with a redundant <i>directory-separator</i>) followed by the <i>filename</i> <tt>"host"</tt>.
<p/>
The example should make it clear that this interpretation is allowed.

<p>
LWG <a href="2939">2939</a> suggests that the the preconditions of the type traits need reevaluation.
This issue focuses specifically on <tt>is_assignable</tt> and, by extension, its variants:
<ul>
<li><tt>is_copy_assignable&lt;T&gt;</tt>, equivalent to <tt>is_assignable&lt;T&amp;, const T&amp;&gt;</tt>,
</li>
<li><tt>is_move_assignable&lt;T&gt;</tt>, equivalent to <tt>is_assignable&lt;T&amp;, T&gt;</tt>,
</li>

  /* magic */</tt>,
</li>
<li><tt>is_trivially_copy_assignable&lt;T&gt;</tt>, equivalent to <tt>is_assignable&lt;T&amp;, const T&amp;&gt; &amp;&amp;
  /* magic */</tt>,
</li>
<li><tt>is_trivially_move_assignable&lt;T&gt;</tt>, equivalent to <tt>is_assignable&lt;T&amp;, T&gt; &amp;&amp;
  /* magic */</tt>,
</li>
<li><tt>is_nothrow_assignable&lt;T, U&gt;</tt>, equivalent to <tt>is_assignable&lt;T, U&gt; &amp;&amp;
    noexcept(declval&lt;T&gt;() = declval&lt;U&gt;())</tt>,
</li>
<li><tt>is_nothrow_copy_assignable&lt;T&gt;</tt>, equivalent to <tt>is_assignable&lt;T&amp;, const T&amp;&gt; &amp;&amp;
    noexcept(declval&lt;T&amp;&gt;() = declval&lt;const T&amp;&gt;())</tt>,

    noexcept(declval&lt;T&amp;&gt;() = declval&lt;T&gt;())</tt>, and
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
We note a discrepancy: <tt>is_copy_assignable&lt;T&gt;</tt> requires <tt>T</tt> to be a complete type, but the
equivalent form <tt>is_assignable&lt;T&amp;, const T&amp;&gt;</tt> <em>does not</em>. The requirement for
<tt>is_copy_assignable&lt;T&gt;</tt> seems sensible, since there's no way to determine whether or not the assignment
<tt>declval&lt;T&amp;&gt;() = declval&lt;const T&amp;&gt;()</tt> is well-formed when <tt>T</tt> is incomplete.
It seems that the same argument should apply to all of the above "assignable" traits, and that they must require that
the referent type is complete when given a reference type parameter to be implementable.

<h3><a name="3103" href="3103">3103.</a> Errors in taking subview of <tt>span</tt> should be ill-formed where possible</h3>
<p><b>Section:</b> 22.7.3.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/span.sub">[span.sub]</a> <b>Status:</b> <a href="lwg-active.html#Open">Open</a>

<p><b>View all issues with</b> <a href="lwg-status.html#Open">Open</a> status.</p>
<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Currently all out-of-bound/inputs errors in the functions taking an subview of <tt>span</tt> lead to undefined behavior, 
even in the situation when they could be detected at compile time. This is inconsistent with the behavior of the <tt>span</tt> 
constructors, which make similar constructs ill-formed.
<p/>
Furthermore, with the current specification of the <tt>subspan</tt> function, the following invocation:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
span&lt;T, N&gt; s;   // N &gt; 0
s.subspan&lt;O&gt;(); // with O &gt; 0
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
is ill-formed when <tt>O &gt; N + 1</tt>, as the return of the function is <tt>span&lt;T, K&gt;</tt> with <tt>K &lt; -1</tt>.
However in case when <tt>O == N + 1</tt>, runtime sized <tt>span</tt> is returned (<tt>span&lt;T, -1&gt;</tt>) instead and 
the behavior of the function is undefined.
<p/>
Firstly, for either run time sized (<tt>N == dynamic_extent</tt>) and fixed sized (<tt>N &gt; 0</tt>) object <tt>s</tt> of 
type <tt>span&lt;T, N&gt;</tt>, the following constructs should be ill-formed, instead of having undefined behavior:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p><tt>s.first&lt;C&gt;()</tt> with <tt>C &lt; 0</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>s.last&lt;C&gt;()</tt> with <tt>C &lt; 0</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>s.subspan&lt;O, E&gt;</tt> with <tt>O &lt; 0</tt> or <tt>E &lt; 0</tt> and <tt>E != dynamic_extent</tt>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
This would follow <tt>span</tt> specification, that make instantiation of <tt>span&lt;T, N&gt;</tt> ill-formed for 
<tt>N &lt; 0</tt> and <tt>N != dynamic_extent</tt>.
<p/>
In addition the following constructs should be made ill-formed for fixed size span <tt>s</tt> of type 
<tt>span&lt;T, N&gt;</tt> (with <tt>N &gt; 0</tt>):
</p>
<ol>
<li><p><tt>s.first&lt;C&gt;()</tt> with <tt>C &gt; N</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>s.last&lt;C&gt;()</tt> with <tt>C &gt; N</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>s.subspan&lt;O, dynamic_extent&gt;()</tt> with <tt>O &gt; N</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>s.subspan&lt;O, C&gt;()</tt> with <tt>O + C &gt; N</tt></p></li>
</ol>
<p>
This will match the <tt>span</tt> constructor that made construction of fixed size <tt>span&lt;T, N&gt;</tt> from fixed 
size <tt>span</tt> of different size ill-formed.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The library wording frequently uses the construction "type <tt>T1</tt> is convertible to type <tt>T2</tt>", 
but this is an undefined phrase.
<p/>
For requirements on user code (e.g. [tuple.rel]), it is unclear whether all expressions of type <tt>T1</tt> 
must satisfy the convertibility requirement, regardless of value category, or whether a single
value category is in view only.
<p/>
Consider:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
struct C 
{
  operator int() &amp;&amp;;
};

int main()
{
  int x = C(); <i>// prvalue can be implicitly converted to int</i>
  C c;
  int y = c;   <i>// lvalue can't</i>
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The library has an "<tt>is_convertible&lt;T1, T2&gt;</tt>" trait, but that checks convertibility 
only for a single value category, not all possible ones.

In C++03 <tt>strstreambuf</tt> was not copyable, because <tt>basic_streambuf</tt> wasn't copyable. 
In C++11 we made <tt>basic_streambuf</tt> copyable by derived classes, and <tt>strstreambuf</tt> 
doesn't define any special members, so it (unintentionally?) became copyable, with completely 
unspecified semantics.
<p/>
VC++ and libc++ make it movable not copyable, and libstdc++ still follows C++03, so it's neither 
movable nor copyable. Making it movable seems to be the sane option, and consistent with 
<tt>filebuf</tt> and <tt>stringbuf</tt>.

In [iterator.requirements.general] paragraph 6, contiguous iterators are defined in terms of general iterators, 
not random-access iterators. Since the defining expressions require random-access and the original paper's 
introduction describes contiguous iterators as a refinement of random-access iterators, contiguous iterators 
should be defined in terms of random-access iterators.

<b>Addresses: networking.ts</b>
<p>
Asynchronous algorithms are started by a call to an <em>initiating function</em>.
When these algorithms are constructed from calls to other initiating functions,
the result is called a <em>composed operation</em>. For example, <tt>async_read</tt> may be 
implemented in terms of zero or more calls to a stream's <tt>async_read_some</tt> algorithm. 
For operations where the caller cannot easily determine ahead of time the storage requirements 
needed for an algorithm to meet its post-conditions, [networking.ts] introduces the
<b>DynamicBuffer</b> concept:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A dynamic buffer encapsulates memory storage that may be automatically
resized as required, where the memory is divided into two regions: readable
bytes followed by writable bytes. [buffer.reqmts.dynamicbuffer]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Signatures for algorithms in the technical specification which accept dynamic
buffers use forwarding references:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<i>// 17.10 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/networking-ts/buffer.async.read.until">[networking.ts::buffer.async.read.until]</a>, asynchronous delimited read operations:</i>

template&lt;
  class AsyncReadStream,
  class DynamicBuffer,
  class CompletionToken&gt;
<i>DEDUCED</i> async_read_until(
  AsyncReadStream&amp; s,
  DynamicBuffer&amp;&amp; b,
  char delim,
  CompletionToken&amp;&amp; token);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Because the initiating function returns immediately, and the associated composed operation executes later, 
it is necessary for the algorithm to manage the lifetime of the dynamic buffer. Guidance for doing so is 
given in the TS:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>13.2.7.5 Lifetime of initiating function arguments [async.reqmts.async.lifetime]</b>
<p>
1. Unless otherwise specified, the lifetime of arguments to initiating functions shall be treated as 
follows: [&hellip;] the implementation does not assume the validity of the argument after the initiating 
function completes [&hellip;] The implementation may make copies of the argument, and all copies shall be
destroyed no later than immediately after invocation of the completion handler.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Given the guidance above, the most sensible approach is for the implementation
to move or make a decay-copy of the argument. An implementation of the TS,
authored by the principal architect of the TS itself, does precisely that:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;
    typename AsyncReadStream,
    typename DynamicBuffer,
    typename ReadHandler&gt;
class read_until_delim_op
{
public:
    template &lt;typename DeducedBuffers&gt;
    read_until_delim_op(
        AsyncReadStream&amp; stream,
        DeducedBuffers&amp;&amp; buffers,
        char delim, ReadHandler&amp; handler)
    : [&hellip;]
      buffers_(std::forward&lt;DeducedBuffers&gt;(buffers))
      [&hellip;]
    {
    }
    [&hellip;]
    DynamicBuffer buffers_;
    [&hellip;]
};

template &lt;
    typename AsyncReadStream,
    typename DynamicBuffer,
    typename ReadHandler&gt;
NET_TS_INITFN_RESULT_TYPE(ReadHandler,
    void (std::error_code, std::size_t))
async_read_until(
    AsyncReadStream&amp; s,
    DynamicBuffer&amp;&amp; buffers,
    char delim,
    ReadHandler&amp;&amp; handler)
{
  // If you get an error on the following line it means that your handler does
  // not meet the documented type requirements for a ReadHandler.
  NET_TS_READ_HANDLER_CHECK(ReadHandler, handler) type_check;

  async_completion&lt;ReadHandler,
    void (std::error_code, std::size_t)&gt; init(handler);

  detail::read_until_delim_op&lt;
    AsyncReadStream,
    typename decay&lt;DynamicBuffer&gt;::type,
    NET_TS_HANDLER_TYPE(ReadHandler, void (std::error_code, std::size_t))&gt;(
        s,
        DynamicBuffer&amp;&amp;buffers,
        delim,
        init.completion_handler)(std::error_code(), 0, 1);

  return init.result.get();
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Given the semantics of dynamic buffers implied by the wording, instances of
dynamic buffers behave more like references to storage types rather than
storage types, as copies refer to the same underlying storage. This can be
seen in the declaration of <tt>dynamic_string_buffer</tt> which meets
the requirements of <b>DynamicBuffer</b>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;typename Elem, typename Traits, typename Allocator&gt;
class dynamic_string_buffer
{
  [&hellip;]
private:
  std::basic_string&lt;Elem, Traits, Allocator&gt;&amp; string_;
  std::size_t size_;
  const std::size_t max_size_;
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
A dynamic string buffer contains a reference to the underlying string. Copies
of a dynamic string buffer refer to the same string. Note that the dynamic
string buffer also contains some state: the <tt>size_</tt> and <tt>max_size_</tt>
data members. This additional metadata informs the dynamic string buffer of
the boundaries between the readable and writable bytes, as well as the maximum
allowed size of the total of the readable and writable bytes.
<p/>
When only one composed operation handles the dynamic buffer, things seem to
work. However, if a composed operation wishes to invoke another composed
operation and pass that dynamic buffer, a problem arises. Consider two composed
operations <tt>f</tt> and <tt>g</tt>, which both operate on an instance of
dynamic buffer. When <tt>f</tt> is invoked, it makes a copy of the dynamic
buffer and then calls <tt>g</tt> with the copy. At this point, <tt>g</tt> must
also make a copy. Copies share the underlying storage, but in the case of
dynamic string buffers each copy maintains its own distinct metadata. When
<tt>g</tt> has finished mutating the dynamic buffer and returns control back
to <tt>f</tt> by invoking the completion handler, the metadata in the copy of
the dynamic buffer held by <tt>f</tt> will not have the changes made by <tt>g</tt>.
<p/>
Another design problem caused by adding metadata to the dynamic buffer concept
is illustrated in the following example code:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class MutableBufferSequence&gt;
std::size_t read(const MutableBufferSequence&amp;)
{
  throw std::exception{};
}

int main()
{
  std::string s;
  assert(s.empty());
  try
  {
    auto b = boost::asio::dynamic_buffer(s);
    b.commit(read(b.prepare(32)));
  }
  catch(const std::exception&amp;)
  {
    assert(s.empty()); // fails
  }
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
While not technically incorrect, it may be surprising to the user that
the string contains additional value-initialized data which was not part
of the original readable bytes (which in this case was empty). The wording of
the dynamic buffer concept does not address this case.
<p/>
The solution we propose is to change the semantics of <b>DynamicBuffer</b>
to represent a true storage type rather than a hybrid reference with metadata.
Instances of dynamic buffers will be passed by reference, and callers will
be required to manage the lifetime of dynamic buffer objects for the duration
of any asynchronous operations. An additional benefit of this change is that
it also solves the problem of exceptions described above.

<p>
<tt>std::function</tt> has deduction guides, but <tt>std::packaged_task</tt>, which is otherwise very
similar, does not. This is surprising to users and I can think of no reason for the former
to be treated differently from the latter. I therefore propose to add deduction guides for
packaged task with the same semantics as the existing ones for function.

<p>
The effects of <tt>monotonic_buffer_resource::release()</tt> are defined as:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Calls <tt>upstream_rsrc-&gt;deallocate()</tt> as necessary to release all allocated memory.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This doesn't give any instruction on what to do with the memory controlled by the <tt>monotonic_buffer_resource</tt> which 
was not allocated, i.e., what to do with the initial buffer provided to its constructor.
<p/>
Boost.Container's pmr implementation expels its initial buffer after a <tt>release()</tt>.
Arthur O'Dwyer's proposed pmr implementation for libc++ reuses the initial buffer after a <tt>release()</tt>, on the 
assumption that this is what the average library user will be expecting.
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
#include &lt;memory_resource&gt;

int main() 
{
  char buffer[100];
  {
    std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource mr(buffer, 100, std::pmr::null_memory_resource());
    mr.release();
    mr.allocate(60);  // A
  }
  {
    std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource mr(buffer, 100, std::pmr::null_memory_resource());
    mr.allocate(60);  // B
    mr.release();
    mr.allocate(60);  // C
  }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Assume that allocation "B" always succeeds.<br/>
With the proposed libc++ implementation, allocations "A" and "C" both succeed.<br/>
With Boost.Container's implementation, allocations "A" and "C" both fail.<br/>
Using another plausible implementation strategy, allocation "A" could succeed but allocation "C" 
could fail. I have been informed that MSVC's implementation does this.
<p/>
Which of these strategies should be permitted by the Standard?
<p/>
Arthur considers "A and C both succeed" to be the obviously most user-friendly strategy, and really 
really hopes it's going to be permitted. Requiring "C" to succeed is unnecessary (and would render MSVC's 
current implementation non-conforming) but could help programmers concerned with portability between 
different implementations.
<p/>
Another side-effect of <tt>release()</tt> which goes underspecified by the Standard is the effect of 
<tt>release()</tt> on <tt>next_buffer_size</tt>. As currently written, my interpretation is that 
<tt>release()</tt> is not permitted to decrease <tt>current_buffer_size</tt>; I'm not sure if this 
is a feature or a bug.
<p/>
Consider this test case (taken from <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D47111#inline-421469">here</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource mr(std::pmr::new_delete_resource());
for (int i=0; i &lt; 100; ++i) {
  mr.allocate(1);  // D
  mr.release();
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Arthur believes it is important that the 100<sup>th</sup> invocation of line "D" does not attempt to allocate 
2<sup>100</sup> bytes from the upstream resource.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Currently the <tt>tuple</tt> constructors of the form:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class... UTypes&gt;
<i>EXPLICIT</i> constexpr tuple(UTypes&amp;&amp;...);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
are not properly constrained in that in the 1-element <tt>tuple</tt> case, the constraints do no short-circuit when 
the constructor would be (incorrectly) considered as a possible copy/move constructor candidate. libc++ has a 
workaround for this, but the additional short-circuiting does not actually appear in the working draft.
<p/>
As an example of why this lack of short circuiting is a problem in practice, consider the following line:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
bool a = std::is_copy_constructible_v&lt;std::tuple&lt;any&gt;&gt;;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The above code will cause a compile error because of a recursive trait definition. The copy constructibility 
check implies doing substitution into the <tt>UTypes&amp;&amp;...</tt> constructor overloads, which in turn 
will check if <tt>tuple&lt;any&gt;</tt> is convertible to any, which in turn will check if <tt>tuple&lt;any&gt;</tt> 
is copy constructible (and so the trait is dependent on itself).
<p/>
I do not provide wording for the proposed fix in anticipation of requires clauses potentially changing how we 
do the specification, however, the basic solution should be similar to what we've done for other standard library 
types, which is to say that the very first constraint should be to check that if <tt>sizeof...(UTypes) == 1</tt> 
and the type, after applying <tt>remove_cvref_t</tt>, is the <tt>tuple</tt> type itself, then we should force 
substitution failure rather than checking any further constraints.

[time.duration]/4 states:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Members of duration shall not throw exceptions other than those thrown by the indicated operations on their representations.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Where representation is defined in the non-normative, brief description at [time.duration]/1:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[&hellip;] A duration has a representation which holds a count of ticks and a tick period. [&hellip;]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
[time.duration.cons]/2 doesn't indicate the operation undergone by its representation, merely stating a postcondition in [time.duration.cons]/3:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects:</i> Constructs an object of type <tt>duration</tt>.
<p/>
<i>Postconditions:</i> <tt>count() == static_cast&lt;rep&gt;(r)</tt>.

<p>
I suggest this reformulation that follows the format of [time.duration.cons]/5.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects:</i> Constructs an object of type duration, constructing <tt>rep_</tt> from <tt>r</tt>.

<tt>std::sub_match::compare</tt> can be called with a <tt>basic_string</tt> or a pointer to a null-terminated 
character sequence, but can't be called with a <tt>basic_string_view</tt>. To compare to a <tt>string_view</tt> 
requires either conversion to <tt>basic_string</tt> (with a potential allocation) or a redundant call to 
<tt>traits_type::length</tt> to calculate a length that is already known.
</p>

<p><i>[2018-07-02, Jonathan comments and completes proposed wording]</i></p>

<p>
To make the relational and equality operators for <tt>sub_match</tt> support string views I propose specifying 
the semantics, not adding another 12 overloaded operators to namespace <tt>std</tt>, in addition to the 42 
already there. This allows them to be implemented as "hidden friends" if the implementation so desires, or to 
retain namespace-scope declaration if backwards compatibility with C++11 - C++17 is preferred.

<p>
The LFTSv3 prospective-working-paper <a href="http://wg21.link/n4758">N4758</a> contains two aliases 
that are already in C++17:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><tt>void_t</tt> in 3.3.1 [fund.ts.v3::meta.type.synop]</p></li>
<li><p><tt>uses_allocator_v</tt> in 5.1 [fund.ts.v3::header.memory.synop]</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
I'd like to propose deleting both, but separate discussion is warranted:
<p/>
<tt>void_t</tt> belongs with the larger "detection idiom", which has not been merged into C++17. We may prefer 
to keep our own local version of the alias.
<p/>
<tt>uses_allocator_v</tt> aliases a version of <tt>uses_allocator</tt> that is modified by this TS. However, 
as specified the alias may actually end up referring to <tt>std::uses_allocator</tt> (because 
<tt>&lt;memory&gt;</tt> is included), not to <tt>std::experimental::uses_allocator</tt>, as may have been intended.

In the LFTSv3 prospective-working-paper <a href="http://wg21.link/n4758">N4758</a>, [propagate_const.class_type_requirements] 
uses a strange turn of phrase:
</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
The last bit is strange: "<tt>ct</tt> is a <tt>const T&amp;</tt> bound to <tt>t</tt>" is not how we usually say things. 
The specification-variables usually denote values, and values can't be references. Perhaps we could just say, 
"<tt>ct</tt> is <tt>as_const(t)</tt>"?

<tt>contract_violation</tt> has an <tt>assertion_level</tt> member 
function that is specified to return text "describing the <i>assertion-level</i>
of the violated contract". There is, however, no <i>assertion-level</i> in
9.11.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/dcl.attr.contract">[dcl.attr.contract]</a>, only <i>contract-level</i>.

While undefined behavior is appropriate for the other cases specified in the earlier bullets, which
describe failure to meet (runtime) semantic requirements, "instantiating a template component or
evaluating a concept" with an incomplete type happens at compile-time, and could potentially be

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
During the discussion of LWG <a href="3120">3120</a> it was pointed out that the current
wording in 20.12.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/mem.res.monotonic.buffer">[mem.res.monotonic.buffer]</a> is contradictory. The introductory text for 
the class says "Each additional buffer is larger than the previous one, following 
a geometric progression" but the spec for <tt>do_allocate</tt> doesn't agree.
<p/>
Firstly, it's impossible for the implementation to ensure a single geometric progression, 
because the size of the next buffer can be arbitrarily large. If the caller asks for an 
allocation that is <tt>N</tt> times bigger than the previous buffer, the next buffer will be at
least <tt>N</tt> times larger than the previous one. If <tt>N</tt> is larger than the
implementation-defined growth factor it's not a geometric progression.
<p/>
Secondly, it's not even clear that each additional buffer will be larger than the previous one. 
Given a <tt>monotonic_buffer_resource</tt> object with little remaining space in <tt>current_buffer</tt>, 
a request to allocate <tt>10*next_buffer_size</tt> will:
<p/>
"set <tt>current_buffer</tt> to <tt>upstream_rsrc-&gt;allocate(n, m)</tt>, where <tt>n</tt> is not
less than <tt>max(bytes, next_buffer_size)</tt> and <tt>m</tt> is not less than <tt>alignment</tt>, 
and increase <tt>next_buffer_size</tt> by an implementation-defined growth factor (which need not 
be integral), then allocate the return block from the newly-allocated <tt>current_buffer</tt>."
<p/>
The effects are to allocate a new buffer of at least <tt>max(10*next_buffer_size, next_buffer_size)</tt> 
bytes, and then do <tt>next_buffer_size *= growth_factor</tt>. If <tt>growth_factor &lt; 10</tt> then 
the next allocated buffer might be smaller than the last one. This means that although 
<tt>next_buffer_size</tt> itself follows a geometric progression, the actual size of any single 
allocated buffer can be much larger than <tt>next_buffer_size</tt>. A graph of the allocated sizes looks 
like a geometric progression with spikes where an allocation size is larger than <tt>next_buffer_size</tt>.
<p/>
If the intention is to set <tt>next_buffer_size = max(n, next_buffer_size * growth_factor)</tt> so 
that every allocation from upstream is larger than the previous one, then we need a change to the 
<i>Effects:</i> to actually say that. Rather than a geometric progression with anomalous spikes,
this would produce a number of different geometric progressions with discontinuous jumps between them.
<p/>
If the spiky interpretation is right then we need to weaken the "Each additional buffer is larger" 
statement. Either way, we need to add a caveat to the "following a geometric progression" text 
because that isn't true for the spiky interpretation or the jumpy interpretation.
<p/>
Thirdly, the <i>Effects:</i> says that the size of the allocated block, <tt>n</tt>, is not less than 
<tt>max(bytes, next_buffer_size)</tt>. This seems to allow an implementation to choose to do 
<tt>n = ceil2(max(bytes, next_buffer_size))</tt> if it wishes (maybe because allocating sizes that 
are a power of 2 simplifies the <tt>monotonic_buffer_resource</tt> implementation, or allows reducing 
the bookkeeping overhead). This still results in an approximate geometric progression (under either 
the spiky or jumpy interpretation) but the graph has steps rather than being a smooth curve (but 
always above the curve). This is another way that "Each additional buffer is larger than the previous 
one" is not guaranteed. Even if <tt>max(bytes, next_buffer_size)</tt> is greater on every call, for a
growth factor between <tt>1.0</tt> and <tt>2.0</tt> the result of <tt>ceil2</tt> might be the same 
for two successive buffers. I see no reason to forbid this, but Pablo suggested it's not allowed 
because it doesn't result in exponential growth (which I disagree with). If this is supposed to be
forbidden, the wording needs to be fixed to forbid it.

</p>
<p>
The library needs a constraint that requires object types to be
default-initializable: the "rangified" versions of the algorithms in

they're likely to choose <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt> despite its subtle
unsuitability.
</p>
<p>
There are two alternative solutions: (1) change <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>
to require <i>default-initialization</i>, (2) change
<tt>is_default_constructible_v</tt> to require default-initializaton and specify
the concept in terms of the trait. (2) is probably too breaking a change to be
feasible.

<p><i>[2018-08-23 Tim provides updated P/R based on Batavia discussion]</i></p>


<p><i>[2018-10-28 Casey expands the problem statement and the P/R]</i></p>

<p>
During Batavia review of <a href="https://wg21.link/p0896r3">P0896R3</a>, Tim
Song noted that <tt>{}</tt> is not necessarily a valid initializer for a
<tt>DefaultConstructible</tt> type. In this sample program
(see <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/I64p_E">Compiler Explorer</a>):
<blockquote>
<pre>
struct S0 { explicit S0() = default; };
struct S1 { S0 x; }; // Note: aggregate
S1 x;   // Ok
S1 y{}; // ill-formed; copy-list-initializes x from {}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<tt>S1</tt> can be default-initialized, but not list-initialized from an empty
<i>braced-init-list</i>. The consensus among those present was that
<tt>DefaultConstructible</tt> should prohibit this class of pathological types
by requiring that initialization form to be valid.

<p>
This sentence - which 20.15.7.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/meta.trans.other">[meta.trans.other]</a> p7 largely duplicates to
specify requirements on program-defined specializations of
<tt>basic_common_reference</tt> - has two problems:
</p><ol>
<li><p>The grammar term "<i>typedef-name</i>" is overconstraining; there's no
reason to prefer a <i>typedef-name</i> here to an actual type, and</p>
</li>
<li><p>"accessible" and "unambiguous" are not properties of <em>types</em>, they
are properties of names and base classes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>While we're here, we may as well strike the unused name <tt>C</tt> which

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
For a 2-element <tt>std::tuple</tt>, attempting to call the "allocator-extended default constructor" might actually 
pass the <tt>allocator_arg</tt> tag and the allocator to the tuple element constructors:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
tuple&lt;any, any&gt; t{allocator_arg, allocator&lt;int&gt;{}};
assert(std::get&lt;0&gt;(t).has_value());
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This assertion should pass according to the standard, but users might expect the elements to be default constructed. 
If you really wanted to construct the elements with the tag and the allocator, you could do:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
tuple&lt;any, any&gt; t{{allocator_arg}, {allocator&lt;int&gt;{}}};
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
or
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
tuple&lt;any, any&gt; t{tuple&lt;allocator_arg_t, allocator&lt;int&gt;&gt;{allocator_arg, allocator&lt;int&gt;{}}};
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The deduction guides for <tt>std::tuple</tt> always treat <tt>{allocator_arg_t, <i>an_allocator</i>}</tt> as the 
allocator-extended default constructor, so this creates an empty tuple:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
tuple t{allocator_arg, allocator&lt;int&gt;{}};
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
And this is needed to create <tt>tuple&lt;any, any&gt;</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
tuple t{allocator_arg, allocator&lt;int&gt;{}, any{}, any{}};
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The proposed resolution seems consistent with that, always calling an allocator-extended constructor for 
<tt>{allocator_arg_t, <i>a</i>}</tt>, instead of the <tt>tuple(UTypes&amp;&amp;...)</tt> constructor.

<p>
20.10.11 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/specialized.algorithms">[specialized.algorithms]</a> para 1.2 describes how the specialized
algorithms with a template parameter named <tt>ForwardIterator</tt> impose
requirements on the type passed as argument for that parameter: it must meet
the <tt><i>Cpp17ForwardIterator</i></tt> requirements, which is consistent with
how the rest of the Library uses the template parameter name
<tt>ForwardIterator</tt>, and many of the required operations on that type must
not throw exceptions, which is <em>not</em> consistent with how the rest of the
Library uses that name.
</p><p>
To avoid confusion and keep the meaning of requirements imposed by template
parameter names crisp, the specialized memory algorithms should use a different
template parameter name for this different set of requirements.
</p><p>
Note that the proposed change has no normative effect; it's simply a
clarification of the existing wording.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In annotating things required to be called by <tt>~vector</tt>, Casey pointed out that several operations I guarded 
with <tt>noexcept</tt> aren't actually mandated by the standard to be <tt>noexcept</tt>. However, the STL, and more 
specifically here, containers, consider inability to destroy an element an unrecoverable condition. This is evidenced 
for the whole STL by 16.5.5.12 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/res.on.exception.handling">[res.on.exception.handling]</a>/3 "Every destructor in the C ++ standard library shall 
behave as if it had a non-throwing exception specification.".
<p/>
As a result, <tt>allocator::destroy</tt> and fancy pointer operations must be non-throwing for valid input, or the 
containers don't make any sense. This is obvious for things like <tt>vector::~vector</tt>, but less obviously the 
containers rely on these guarantees whenever inserting more than one element, etc.
<p/>
Moreover, we too narrowly specify the domain of the <tt>pointer_traits::pointer_to</tt> requirement in the 
<tt><i>Cpp17Allocator</i></tt> requirements, because any node-based container that uses container-internal sentinel 
nodes needs to be able to form pointers to said sentinel nodes; that operation must also be non-throwing.

<p>
20.11.1.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/unique.ptr.single">[unique.ptr.single]</a> p1 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The default type for the template parameter <tt>D</tt> is <tt>default_delete</tt>. A client-supplied template argument 
<tt>D</tt> shall be a function object type (19.14), lvalue reference to function, or lvalue reference to function object 
type for which, given a value <tt>d</tt> of type <tt>D</tt> and a value ptr of type <tt>unique_ptr&lt;T, D&gt;::pointer</tt>, 
the expression <tt>d(ptr)</tt> is valid and has the effect of disposing of the pointer as appropriate for that deleter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
That means this is undefined:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;memory&gt;

struct IncompleteBase;

struct Deleter {
  void operator()(IncompleteBase*) const;
};

struct IncompleteDerived;

struct X {
  std::unique_ptr&lt;IncompleteDerived, Deleter&gt; p;
  ~X();
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<tt>unique_ptr::pointer</tt> is <tt>IncompleteDerived*</tt>, but <tt>is_invocable&lt;Deleter, IncompleteDerived*&gt;</tt> 
is unknowable until the type is complete (see LWG <a href="3099">3099</a> etc).
<p/>
The intention is that <tt>IncompleteDerived</tt> only needs to be complete when the deleter is invoked, which is in the 
definition of <tt>X::~X()</tt> for this example. But the requirement for <tt>d(ptr)</tt> to be valid requires a complete type. 
If the <tt>unique_ptr</tt> implementation adds <tt>static_assert(is_invocable_v&lt;D, pointer&gt;)</tt> to enforce the 
requirement, the example above fails to compile. GCC recently added that assertion.
<p/>
Do we want to relax that requirement, or do we want to force the code above to define <tt>Deleter::pointer</tt> as 
<tt>IncompleteBase*</tt> so that the <tt>is_invocable</tt> condition can be checked?
<p/>
The destructor and <tt>reset</tt> member function already require that the deleter can be invoked (and that <i>Requires:</i> 
element will be turned into a <i>Mandates:</i> one soon). We can just remove that requirement from the preamble for the 
class template, or say that the expression only needs to be valid when the destructor and <tt>reset</tt> member are 
instantiated. We could also rephrase it in terms of <tt>is_invocable_v&lt;D, unique_ptr&lt;T, D&gt;::pointer&gt;</tt>.

22.6.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/stack">[stack]</a> p1 says:
</p>
<blockquote>
Any sequence container supporting operations <tt>back()</tt>, <tt>push_back()</tt> and <tt>pop_back()</tt> can be used to 
instantiate <tt>stack</tt>. 
</blockquote>

<p>but then in 22.6.6.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/stack.defn">[stack.defn]</a> we have the following code:</p>
<pre>
template&lt;class... Args&gt;
  decltype(auto) emplace(Args&amp;&amp;... args)
    { return c.emplace_back(std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...); }
</pre>

<p>The same pattern appears in 22.6.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/queue">[queue]</a>.</p>

<p>I see two ways to resolve this:</p>
<p>The first is to add <tt>emplace_back()</tt> to the list of requirements for underlying containers for <tt>stack</tt> and <tt>queue</tt></p>

<p>The second is to replace the calls to <tt>c.emplace_back(std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...)</tt> with <tt>c.emplace(c.end(), std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...)</tt>. We can do this w/o messing with the list above because <tt>emplace</tt> is part of the sequence container requirements, while <tt>emplace_back</tt> is not. I checked the libc++ implementation of <tt>vector</tt>, <tt>deque</tt>, and <tt>list</tt>, and they all do the same thing for <tt>emplace(end(), ...)</tt> and <tt>emplace_back(...)</tt>.</p>

<p>
The constructor for <tt>std::system_error</tt> taking a single argument of type <tt>std::error_code</tt> is 
not marked explicit, which allows implicit conversions from <tt>error_code</tt> to <tt>system_error</tt>. I

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Throughout the standard library, the opposite of the verb "to end" is "to begin", not to "to start". In this 
respect, all the overloads of <tt>std::basic_string::starts_with</tt> and <tt>std::basic_string_view::starts_with</tt> 
are named inconsistently. These calls were added in <a href="https://wg21.link/p0457r2">P0457R2</a>, which refers 
to analogous functions in Java, Python, Qt, LLVM, WebKit, all of which use the term "start". But, in our opinion, 
the C++ standard library should first be consistent with itself.

<p>
From the wording, function pointers are never clearly considered. P1 infers
support for only objects, but it is not clear that wording is intended to be a
deliberate restriction, or is casual wording.
<p/>
Paragraph 2 mandates that we cannot instantiate for reference types, and do
support incomplete types, but still does not consider function types. Calling
out references specifically, as they are not object types, suggests the inferred
support for only objects in p1 is more a case of casual phrasing, than deliberate
intent.
<p/>
However, if we did intend to support function pointers, we may want to consider
adding a function-call operator, constrained to supporting pointer-to function types.
One other possibility is that the explicit conversion to <tt>pointer</tt> already serves that
purpose, although I need to double-check the core language that contextual
conversions to function pointer are considered when invoking the function call
operator.  If this <em>is</em> the case, then I suggest a note to that effect in
[memory.observer.ptr.conv] instead.

16.4.1.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/structure.specifications">[structure.specifications]</a>/p3.4 specifies the <i>Expects:</i> element as "the conditions (sometimes termed preconditions) 
that the function assumes to hold whenever it is called". This is nonsensical (functions can't "assume" things because 
they're not sentient), and more to the point it says nothing about what happens if those conditions don't hold. This is 
a serious problem because the whole point of introducing <i>Expects:</i> was to correct the vagueness of <i>Requires:</i> on 
exactly that point.
<p/>
16.5.4.11 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/res.on.required">[res.on.required]</a>/p2 is more explicit: "Violation of any preconditions specified in a function's <i>Expects:</i> 
element results in undefined behavior." However, I think putting the actual meaning of the <i>Expects:</i> element in a subclause 
called "Requires paragraph", 21 pages away from where <i>Expects:</i> is nominally specified, is asking too much of the reader. 
Splitting the specification of <i>Requires:</i> into two places 21 pages apart also seems needlessly obtuse, but that's less pressing 
since <i>Requires:</i> should be going away soon.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
I (Billy O'Neal) attempted to change MSVC++'s standard library to avoid instantiating allocators' <tt>operator==</tt> 
for allocators that are declared <tt>is_always_equal</tt> to reduce the number of template instantiations emitted into .objs.
<p/>
In so doing I introduced an unrelated bug related to POCMA handling, but it brought my attention to 
<a href="https://github.com/boostorg/poly_collection/blob/5ed5d5e99336130783bdb33126d8629890235aed/test/test_utilities.hpp#L324">this 
allocator</a>. This allocator doesn't meet the allocator requirements because it is getting <tt>std::allocator</tt>'s 
<tt>operator==</tt> and <tt>operator!=</tt> which don't compare the root member. However, if this had been a conforming C++14 
allocator with its own <tt>==</tt> and <tt>!=</tt> we would still be treating it as <tt>is_always_equal</tt>, as it picks that 
up by deriving from <tt>std::allocator</tt>.
<p/>
<tt>std::allocator</tt> doesn't actually need <tt>is_always_equal</tt> because the defaults provided by <tt>allocator_traits</tt> 
will say <tt>true_type</tt> for it, since implementers don't make <tt>std::allocator</tt> stateful.
<p/>
Billy O'Neal thinks this is NAD on the grounds that we need to be able to add things or change the behavior of standard library types.
<p/>
Stephan T Lavavej thinks we should resolve this anyway because we don't know of an implementation for which this would change 
the default answer provided by <tt>allocator_traits</tt>.

<p>
The 2-arg <tt>hypot</tt> function specified in the C standard is required to avoid overflow and underflow 
(7.12.7.3 p2). Furthermore C's Annex F (IEC 60559 floating-point arithmetic) defines special cases for 
inputs of <tt>&plusmn;0</tt> and <tt>&plusmn;inf</tt> (F. 10.4.3). The 3-arg <tt>hypot</tt> function 
26.8.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/c.math.hypot3">[c.math.hypot3]</a> is only specified as "<i>Returns:</i> 
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msqrt><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo>
<msup><mi>y</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>z</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></msqrt></math>.". This is 
inconsistent with the 2-arg overload.
<p/>
It is not clear whether C's Annex F is "imported" into the C++ standard. [cmath.syn] p1 suggests that it 
is: "The contents and meaning of the header <tt>&lt;cmath&gt;</tt> are the same as the C standard library 
header <tt>&lt;math.h&gt;</tt>, [&hellip;]".

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Per <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/meta.rel#tab:type-traits.relationship">Table 49</a>
in 20.15.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/meta.rel">[meta.rel]</a>, the preconditions for both
<tt>is_convertible&lt;From, To&gt;</tt> and
<tt>is_nothrow_convertible&lt;From, To&gt;</tt> are:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<tt>From</tt> and <tt>To</tt> shall be complete types, arrays of unknown bound,
or <i>cv</i> <tt>void</tt> types.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Consequently, this program fragment:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
struct S;
static_assert(is_convertible_v&lt;S, const S&amp;&gt;);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
has undefined behavior despite that the actual behavior of <tt>is_convertible</tt>
specified in <a href="https://wg21.link/meta.rel#5">[meta.rel]/5</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
-5- The predicate condition for a template specialization
<tt>is_convertible&lt;From, To&gt;</tt> shall be satisfied if and only if the
return expression in the following code would be well-formed, including any
implicit conversions to the return type of the function:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
To test() {
  return declval&lt;From&gt;();
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>[ <i>Note:</i> &hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
is well-formed: <tt>declval&lt;S&gt;()</tt> is an xvalue of type <tt>S</tt>,
which certainly does implicitly convert to <tt>const S&amp;</tt>. We should
relax the precondition to allow this perfectly valid case (and similar cases
like <tt>is_convertible&lt;S, S&amp;&amp;&gt;</tt>), letting the cases that
would in fact be invalid fall through to the blanket "incompletely-defined

</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
After acceptance of <a href="https://wg21.link/p0919r3">P0919R3</a> into the new working draft (<a href="https://wg21.link/n4791">N4791</a>), 
it is possible that an unordered container's member type <tt>key_equal</tt> is different from its template argument for <tt>Pred</tt> 
(the former being <tt>Hash::transparent_key_equal</tt> while the latter being <tt>std::equal_to&lt;Key&gt;</tt>). However, it is 
unclear which is stored in the container and used as the predicate in this case.
<p/>
In particular, [unord.req]/4 says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[&hellip;] The container's object of type <tt>Pred</tt> &mdash; denoted by <tt>pred</tt> &mdash; is called the <i>key equality 
predicate</i> of the container.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In Table 70, the row for <tt>X::key_equal</tt> places requirements to <tt>Pred</tt> and not to <tt>Hash::transparent_key_equal</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Requires:</i> <tt>Pred</tt> is <i>Cpp17CopyConstructible</i>. <tt>Pred</tt> shall be a binary predicate that takes two arguments 
of type <tt>Key</tt>. <tt>Pred</tt> is an equivalence relation.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The specification of <tt>operator==</tt> and <tt>operator!=</tt> in [unord.req]/12 uses <tt>Pred</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[&hellip;] The behavior of a program that uses <tt>operator==</tt> or operator!= on unordered containers is undefined unless
the <tt>Pred</tt> function object has the same behavior for both containers and the equality comparison function for <tt>Key</tt> 
is a refinement(footnote 227) of the partition into equivalent-key groups produced by <tt>Pred</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The exception safety guarantees in [unord.req.except] mentions "the container's <tt>Pred</tt> object" twice.
<p/>
The <i>noexcept-specifier</i>s of unordered containers' move assignment operator and <tt>swap</tt> member function are all in 
terms of <tt>Pred</tt>.
<p/>
I think the intent is to make <tt>Hash::transparent_key_equal</tt> override <tt>Pred</tt>. If that's true, then all the 
abovementioned uses of <tt>Pred</tt> in the specification should probably be changed to uses <tt>key_equal</tt>.

doesn't define <tt>operator-&gt;</tt> (23.3.2.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/iterator.traits">[iterator.traits]</a>). We recently removed <tt>operator-&gt;</tt>

With the acceptance of <a href="https://wg21.link/p1252r2">P1252R2</a> the committee decided to deprecate <tt>operator-&gt;</tt> 
of <tt>move_iterator</tt>, interestingly without mentioning what should happen with its current <tt>pointer</tt> typedef (which
is equal to the template parameter <tt>Iterator</tt> and thus never <tt>void</tt>). Effectively this is a very similar situation

<p>
We don't require that the <tt>Compare</tt> template parameter can be invoked with arguments of the queue's value type. 
It seems like something we can use <i>Mandates:</i> for, since it'll be ill-formed otherwise. Something like 
<tt>is_invocable_r_v&lt;bool, Compare&amp;, value_type&amp;, value_type&amp;&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
This might also apply to the <tt>Compare</tt> parameter for the <tt>merge</tt> and <tt>sort</tt> functions of 
<tt>forward_list</tt> and <tt>list</tt>.

Notice the missing <tt>ConvertibleTo</tt> requirements in the latter. Looking at the

this requirement, albeit in the Ranges TS-format.

<p><i>[2019-03-03; Daniel comments]</i></p>

<p>
Given that the accepted proposal <a href="https://wg21.link/p0896r4">P0896R4</a> voted in San Diego 
did contain the same error I decided to open this issue instead of submitting an editorial change request.
</p>

<p><i>[2019-03-05 Priority set to 1 after reflector discussion]</i></p>

<p>
Casey: The correct fix here is to remove the <tt>ConvertibleTo</tt> requirement from the header 
synopsis. <tt>UniformRandomBitGenerator</tt>s have integral result types, and the core language guarantees 
that all integral types are convertible to all other integral types. We don't need to validate the core 
language in the associated constraints of <tt>ranges::shuffle</tt>.

<p>
The new functions added by <a href="https://wg21.link/p0591r4">P0591R4</a> misbehave for <i>cv</i>-qualified types. 
A specialization <tt>std::uses_allocator&lt;X, Alloc&gt;</tt> will not match <tt>const X</tt>, so 
<tt>std::uses_allocator_construction_args&lt;const X&gt;</tt> will return a different result from 
<tt>std::uses_allocator_construction_args&lt;X&gt;</tt>. It makes no sense to construct <tt>X</tt> and <tt>const X</tt> 
differently, either the type wants to use an allocator or it doesn't. I think 
<tt>std::uses_allocator_construction_args&lt;T&gt;</tt> should remove <i>cv</i>-qualifiers before checking 
<tt>uses_allocator</tt>, so that it works consistently. 
<p/>
We could consider changing <tt>std::make_obj_using_allocator</tt> to also strip <i>cv</i>-qualifiers, but it's not 
necessary as C++17 guaranteed elision works even for prvalues of <tt>const</tt> types. We only need to make the 
construction args ignore <i>cv</i>-qualifiers. We don't want to make <i>cv</i>-qualified types ill-formed, because 
that would require users of uses-allocator construction to strip <i>cv</i>-qualifiers before using these functions, 
e.g. in cases like <tt>std::tuple&lt;const int&gt; t(allocator_arg, alloc, 1);</tt>

<p>
The working paper uses the special elements <i>Mandates:</i>, <i>Expects:</i> as well as 
<i>Requires:</i> to types, albeit 16.4.1.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/structure.specifications">[structure.specifications]</a> defines them 
only for functions, for example 16.4.1.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/structure.specifications">[structure.specifications]</a> sub-bullet (3.4):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Expects:</i> the conditions (sometimes termed preconditions) that the function assumes to hold whenever
it is called.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Examples for such usages on types are (from <a href="https://wg21.link/n4800">N4800</a>):
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>21.2.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/char.traits.typedefs">[char.traits.typedefs]</a> for types <tt>int_type</tt> and <tt>state_type</tt></p></li>
<li><p>20.4.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/pair.astuple">[pair.astuple]</a> for <tt>tuple_element&lt;I, pair&lt;T1, T2&gt;&gt;::type</tt></p></li>
<li><p>20.5.3.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/tuple.helper">[tuple.helper]</a> for <tt>tuple_element&lt;I, tuple&lt;Types...&gt;&gt;::type</tt></p></li>
<li><p>20.5.3.9 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/tuple.traits">[tuple.traits]</a> for <tt>uses_allocator&lt;tuple&lt;Types...&gt;, Alloc&gt;</tt></p></li>
<li><p>Table 62 &mdash; "Container requirements" for type <tt>XX::value_type</tt></p></li>
<li><p>Table 65 &mdash; "Allocator-aware container requirements" for type <tt>allocator_type</tt></p></li>
<li><p>Table 69 &mdash; "Associative container requirements" for types <tt>X::value_type</tt> and <tt>X::key_compare</tt></p></li>
<li><p>Table 70 &mdash; "Unordered associative container requirements" for types <tt>X::value_type</tt> and <tt>X::key_equal</tt></p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Instead of replacing these elements usages for these places by extra wording to reach the same effects I
recommend to update instead 16.4.1.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/structure.specifications">[structure.specifications]</a> to ensure that requirement-expressing elements
are defined in a way that it also allows to express requirements imposed on types by these elements to standardize 
"existing practice". 
<p/>
Considering details, it seems obvious that <i>Mandates:</i>, <i>Expects:</i> as well as <i>Requires:</i> are "suitable"
to be defined for types (With the acceptance of <a href="https://wg21.link/p1463r1">P1463R1</a> there are now also
<i>Mandates:</i> for types such as Table 65 &mdash; "Allocator-aware container requirements" for type <tt>allocator_type</tt>). 
<p/>
For <i>Constraints:</i> the meaning would not be so clear: Should it mean that there is conditionally a type defined or not? 
According to  the submitters knowledge there are currently no known examples for <i>Constraints:</i> to specify 
constraint on types, therefore I'm suggesting to restrict this extension to <i>Mandates:</i>, <i>Expects:</i>, 
and <i>Requires:</i> alone.
</p>

<p><i>[2019-03-15 Priority set to 3 after reflector discussion]</i></p>


<p><i>[2019-03-15; Daniel comments and provides wording]</i></p>

<p>
During the preparation of the wording for this issue it was found that we should allow 
<i>Remarks:</i> elements to be used for other things than functions. One example of imposed 
restrictions can be found in 17.11.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/cmp.common">[cmp.common]</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class... Ts&gt;
struct common_comparison_category {
  using type = <i>see below</i>;
};
</pre>
<p>
-2- <i>Remarks:</i> The member <i>typedef-name</i> <tt>type</tt> denotes the common comparison type 
(11.10.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/class.spaceship">[class.spaceship]</a>) of <tt>Ts...</tt>, the expanded parameter pack. [&hellip;]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The discussion of this issue speaks of "type" restrictions (versus the specified restrictions on
functions), because even the non-type template argument restrictions of 20.4.4 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/pair.astuple">[pair.astuple]</a> 
appear in the context of a member type specification, but there are examples where not really a 
single (member) type is involved, e.g. in the 20.5.3.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/tuple.helper">[tuple.helper]</a> example mentioned above. 
<p/>
Another example is when such elements are used for the specification of template specializations, e.g.
in 20.5.3.6 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/tuple.helper">[tuple.helper]</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class T&gt; struct tuple_size;
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-1- <i>Remarks:</i> All specializations of <tt>tuple_size</tt> shall satisfy the 
<i>Cpp17UnaryTypeTrait</i> requirements (20.15.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/meta.rqmts">[meta.rqmts]</a>) with a base characteristic 
of <tt>integral_constant&lt;size_t, N&gt;</tt> for some <tt>N</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Besides class template specializations, a second relevant use-case is the specification of member types 
(Which are not necessarily part of a template), typically within the requirement tables, e.g. in 
Table 62 &mdash; "Container requirements"'s entry <tt>X::value_type</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Requires:</i> <tt>T</tt> is <i>Cpp17Erasable</i> from <tt>X</tt>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The suggested wording tries to cover the generalization by means of the term "non-function 
entities" in addition to the existing functions to prevent being enforced to enumerate all entities
to which the extended rules apply.

<p>
Note that neither specifies the value of the stored pointer when the resulting <tt>weak_ptr</tt> is empty.
This didn't matter &mdash; the stored pointer value was unobservable for an empty <tt>weak_ptr</tt> &mdash;
until we added <tt>atomic&lt;weak_ptr&gt;</tt>. 20.11.8.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.atomic.weak">[util.smartptr.atomic.weak]</a>/15 says:
</p>

share ownership, or both are empty. The weak form may fail spuriously. See 31.7.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/atomics.types.operations">[atomics.types.operations]</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Two empty <tt>weak_ptr</tt> objects that store different pointer values are not equivalent. We <em>could</em>
correct this by changing 20.11.8.2 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/util.smartptr.atomic.weak">[util.smartptr.atomic.weak]</a>/15 to "Two <tt>weak_ptr</tt> objects are
equivalent if they are both empty, or if they share ownership and store the same pointer value." In practice,
an implementation of <tt>atomic&lt;weak_ptr&gt;</tt> will CAS on both the ownership (control block pointer)
and stored pointer value, so it seems cleaner to pin down the stored pointer value of an empty <tt>weak_ptr</tt>.

20.6.3 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/optional.optional">[optional.optional]</a> appears to allow arrays:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<tt>T</tt> shall be an object type other than <i>cv</i> <tt>in_place_t</tt> or <i>cv</i> <tt>nullopt_t</tt> and shall 
satisfy the <i>Cpp17Destructible</i> requirements (Table 30).
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But instantiating it fails, because <tt>value_or</tt> attempts to return <tt>T</tt> by value, which isn't possible for an array type.
<p/>
Existing practice seems to be to reject array types. Libstdc++ and libc++ give an error for the signature of <tt>value_or</tt>, 
and MSVC fails a static assert saying the type needs to be destructible (which is misleading, because <tt>int[2]</tt> 
is destructible, but either way it's ill-formed).

<p>
MSVC++ (and apparently libc++) have asserts that <tt>std::prev</tt> only accepts <tt>BidirectionalIterator</tt>s, 
because it's declared in the standard as accepting only <tt>BidirectionalIterator</tt>. libc++ changed their tests 
(in <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/f51ee632475654a396f93da9d36841989e1c7742">this commit</a>), 
apparently from a bug report from Ville and Jonathan, saying that one could theoretically call <tt>std::prev</tt> 
with a negative number.
<p/>
The standardese in [iterator.operations] strongly indicates that <tt>prev</tt> requires a <tt>BidirectionalIterator</tt>, 
but I don't see the usual wording that connects template type parameters of that name to the <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> 
requirements or similar. So perhaps one could argue that the name <tt>Bidirectional</tt> there has no meaning. Even 
if that is the case, that's a defect in the other direction.

<p>
The overloads of <tt>lerp</tt> should be marked as <tt>noexcept</tt>, and this can be explained through the Lakos Rule. 
This function does not specify any undefined behaviour, and as such has no preconditions. This implies it has a wide 
contract, meaning it cannot throw, and thus can be marked as <tt>noexcept</tt>.

<p>
<tt>sub_match&lt;I&gt;</tt> derives publicly from <tt>pair&lt;I,I&gt;</tt>, and so inherits 
<tt>pair::swap(pair&amp;)</tt>. This means that the following program fails:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;regex&gt;
#include &lt;cassert&gt;

int main()
{
  std::sub_match&lt;const char*&gt; a, b;
  a.matched = true;
  a.swap(b);
  assert(b.matched);
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The <tt>pair::swap(pair&amp;)</tt> member should be hidden by a <tt>sub_match::swap(sub_match&amp;)</tt> 
member that does the right thing.

<p>
The <tt>Boolean</tt> concept was recently added to the C++20 working draft. Unfortunately, there are 
Windows platform headers that use the name "<tt>Boolean</tt>" in the global namespace. Programs that import 
namespace <tt>std</tt> into the global namespace via using directive &mdash; as is common in the 
Windows codebase &mdash; will be broken by the C++20 Standard Library if this name is not changed.

This issue was intensively discussed on the <a href="http://lists.isocpp.org/lib/2019/05/index.php">LWG reflector</a>.
