<p>27.7.4 [std.manip] paragraph 3 says (clause numbering added for
exposition):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns: An object s of unspecified type such that if [1] out is an (instance
of) basic_ostream then the expression out&lt;&lt;s behaves as if f(s) were
called, and if [2] in is an (instance of) basic_istream then the expression
in&gt;&gt;s behaves as if f(s) were called. Where f can be defined as: ios_base&amp;
f(ios_base&amp; str, ios_base::fmtflags mask) { // reset specified flags
str.setf(ios_base::fmtflags(0), mask); return str; } [3] The expression
out&lt;&lt;s has type ostream&amp; and value out. [4] The expression in&gt;&gt;s
has type istream&amp; and value in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the definitions [1] and [2] for out and in, surely [3] should read:
&quot;The expression out &lt;&lt; s has type basic_ostream&amp; ...&quot; and
[4] should read: &quot;The expression in &gt;&gt; s has type basic_istream&amp;
...&quot;</p>
<p>If the wording in the standard is correct, I can see no way of implementing
any of the manipulators so that they will work with wide character streams.</p>
<p>e.g. wcout &lt;&lt; setbase( 16 );</p>
<p>Must have value 'wcout' (which makes sense) and type 'ostream&amp;' (which
doesn't).</p>
<p>The same &quot;cut'n'paste&quot; type also seems to occur in Paras 4,5,7 and
8. In addition, Para 6 [setfill] has a similar error, but relates only to
ostreams.</p>
<p>I'd be happier if there was a better way of saying this, to make it clear
that the value of the expression is &quot;the same specialization of
basic_ostream as out&quot;&amp;</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>Replace section 27.7.4 [std.manip] except paragraph 1 with the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2- The type designated smanip in each of the following function descriptions is implementation-specified and may be different for each
function.<br/>
<br/>
<tt>smanip resetiosflags(ios_base::fmtflags mask);</tt><br/>

-3- Returns: An object s of unspecified type such that if out is an instance of basic_ostream&lt;charT,traits&gt; then the expression out&lt;&lt;s behaves
as if f(s, mask) were called, or if in is an instance of basic_istream&lt;charT,traits&gt; then the expression in&gt;&gt;s behaves as if
f(s, mask) were called. The function f can be defined as:*<br/>
<br/>
[Footnote: The expression cin &gt;&gt; resetiosflags(ios_base::skipws) clears ios_base::skipws in the format flags stored in the
basic_istream&lt;charT,traits&gt; object cin (the same as cin &gt;&gt; noskipws), and the expression cout &lt;&lt; resetiosflags(ios_base::showbase) clears
ios_base::showbase in the format flags stored in the basic_ostream&lt;charT,traits&gt; object cout (the same as cout &lt;&lt;
noshowbase). --- end footnote]<br/>

<p><i>[Tokyo - The LWG noted that issue <a href="216">216</a> involves
the same paragraphs.]</i></p>


<p><i>[Post-Tokyo: The issues list maintainer combined the proposed
resolution of this issue with the proposed resolution for issue <a href="216">216</a> as they both involved the same paragraphs, and were so
intertwined that dealing with them separately appear fraught with
error.  The full text was supplied by Bill Plauger; it was cross
checked against changes supplied by Andy Sawyer. It should be further
checked by the LWG.]</i></p>
