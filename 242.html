<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>The algorithms transform(), accumulate(), inner_product(),
partial_sum(), and adjacent_difference() require that the function
object supplied to them shall not have any side effects.</p>

<p>The standard defines a side effect in 6.10.1 <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/intro.execution">[intro.execution]</a> as:</p>
<blockquote><p>-7- Accessing an object designated by a volatile lvalue (basic.lval),
modifying an object, calling a library I/O function, or calling a function
that does any of those operations are all side effects, which are changes
in the state of the execution environment.</p></blockquote>

<p>As a consequence, the function call operator of a function object supplied
to any of the algorithms listed above cannot modify data members, cannot
invoke any function that has a side effect, and cannot even create and
modify temporary objects.&nbsp; It is difficult to imagine a function object
that is still useful under these severe limitations. For instance, any
non-trivial transformator supplied to transform() might involve creation
and modification of temporaries, which is prohibited according to the current
wording of the standard.</p>

<p>On the other hand, popular implementations of these algorithms exhibit
uniform and predictable behavior when invoked with a side-effect-producing
function objects. It looks like the strong requirement is not needed for
efficient implementation of these algorithms.</p>

<p>The requirement of&nbsp; side-effect-free function objects could be
replaced by a more relaxed basic requirement (which would hold for all
function objects supplied to any algorithm in the standard library):</p>
<blockquote><p>A function objects supplied to an algorithm shall not invalidate
any iterator or sequence that is used by the algorithm. Invalidation of
the sequence includes destruction of the sorting order if the algorithm
relies on the sorting order (see section 25.3 - Sorting and related operations
[lib.alg.sorting]).</p></blockquote>

<p>I can't judge whether it is intended that the function objects supplied
to transform(), accumulate(), inner_product(), partial_sum(), or adjacent_difference()
shall not modify sequence elements through dereferenced iterators.</p>

<p>It is debatable whether this issue is a defect or a change request.
Since the consequences for user-supplied function objects are drastic and
limit the usefulness of the algorithms significantly I would consider it
a defect.</p>


<p id="res-242"><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>

<p><i>Things to notice about these changes:</i></p>

<ol>
<li> <i>The fully-closed ("[]" as opposed to half-closed "[)" ranges
     are intentional. we want to prevent side-effects from
     invalidating the end iterators.</i></li>

<li> <i>That has the unintentional side-effect of prohibiting
     modification of the end element as a side-effect. This could
     conceivably be significant in some cases.</i></li>

<li> <i>The wording also prevents side-effects from modifying elements
     of the output sequence. I can't imagine why anyone would want
     to do this, but it is arguably a restriction that implementors
     don't need to place on users.</i></li>

<li> <i>Lifting the restrictions imposed in #2 and #3 above is possible
     and simple, but would require more verbiage.</i></li>
</ol>

<blockquote><p>
  -2- Requires: in the ranges [first1, last1], [first2, first2 +
  (last1 - first1)] and [result, result + (last1- first1)], op and
  binary_op shall neither modify elements nor invalidate iterators or
  subranges.
  [Footnote: The use of fully closed ranges is intentional --end footnote]

<p>Change 26.4.1/2 from:</p>

<blockquote><p>

<p>Change 26.4.2/2 from:</p>

<blockquote><p>

<p>Change 26.4.3/4 from:</p>

<p><i>[Copenhagen: Proposed resolution was modified slightly. Matt
added footnotes pointing out that the use of closed ranges was
intentional.]</i></p>
